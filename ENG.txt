Chicken pox  varicella  .
Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster  VZV  .
Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox .
A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops .
It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox .
It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds .
In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby .
Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i . . till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started .
Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles .
In most of the children 200-300 blisters erupt that later become scabs .
Chicken pox can attack both young and adult , men and women .
Most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence .
But if adults who had never been a victim of chicken pox come into contact with such a case , they are in danger of contraction and they may suffer from chicken pox in adulthood .
Chicken pox is more serious in adolescents and adults in comparison with children .
Fever stays for a longer time .
Keeping infected persons away from school or work helps in decreasing the spread of the virus but vaccination is an effective solution to escape the pain of chicken pox .
Fever is estimated with symptoms like high fever , acute body pain , headache , joint pain , eye pain and finding of papules on body .
Besides the above general symptoms , complaints of bleeding from teeth , mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox .
Tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than 1 lac on blood test .
Dengue fever occurs after a sting of aedes aegypti .
Aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time .

Diabetes is such a kind of disease as a result of which sugar becomes very high in blood .
Diabetes is a serious disease which , if not controlled , can be killing .
On being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar .
Sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin .
If you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes .
Frequent feeling of urination .
Feeling more thirsty and dim vision .
Physical inability in sexual activities .
Numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them .
Problems occurring from diabetes .
The following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes .
Excess of sugar in blood , long term complexities .
Damage to tendons or neuropathy .
Damage to kidney or nephropathy .
Damage to eyes or retinopathy .
Disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels .
Long term complexities of diabetes .
damage to tendons : diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands .
Shivering , numbness , inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards .
If treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs .
Damage to kidney : Delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required .
Diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness .
Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur .
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes .
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this .
Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion .
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle .
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests .
Every disease occurs due to a type of virus .
Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope .
If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person .
After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person .
Usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes .
High fever .
Acute pain .
Stiffness in neck .
Stiffness in body .
Strokes in body .
Nausea and vomiting .
Fainting or total nervousness .
As soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health center , sub-divisional government hospital or district hospital .
Malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community .
Disease carrying mosquitoes mainly reside outside home in paddy fields , ponds and ditches filled with water .
Pay special attention towards cleanliness at home and outside .
Fill the ditches , cut tall grass and bushes .
Wear pants , pyjama , dhoti , socks , full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible .
Do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house .
Cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging .
Use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties .
Get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time .
Hepatitis-A is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world .
This occurs due to Hepatitis-A virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness .
Virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients .
Hepatitis-A viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage .
The virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious .
Therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops .
Nausea , jaundice , purge , light colored faeces , stomach ache , weakness , tiredness , fever , shivering , not feeling hungry , neck pain etc .
Symptoms are dependent on the frequency of emergence .
Hepatitis-A and V are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses .
Every type of hepatitis is different .
Hepatitis-A can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-B .
Similarly , hepatitis-B can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-A .
The vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitis-A .
Primary vaccination keeps a person safe for a year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about 20 years .
A combined vaccine is available from Glaxosmithkline which provides safety from , both hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B through a single safety order administered at 0 . . months .
The combined vaccine of hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B is available in two forms .
Paediatric dose : One dose is of 0 . ml for children and adolescents .
Adult dose : The dose is of 1 . ml for adults of the age of 16 years and above .
Hepatitis-B is a worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitis-B virus  HBV  .
HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs .
The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted .
The results of infection are different and unexpected .
The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system .
Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV .
In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year .
Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included .
HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person .
The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination .
After vaccination people who have developed protective anti-bacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases .
With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B .
Yellow fever is also called yellow jack , black vomit , Negro 's vomit or American Plague .
The combined vaccine is made for children and adults .
What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again .
The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence .
The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952 .
On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo  Egypt  in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare .
All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services .
Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born .
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India .
This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state .
Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh .
Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only .
Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar .
Gross reproduction rate  the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time  which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3 . .
Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period .
Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas .
It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state .
Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas .
About one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within 24 months .
A little less than half of the mothers  46 percent  give birth to more than 3 kids .
About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger .
It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular .
According to the estimates of Sample Registration System  S . . .  the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9 .
The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate  68  .
Two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself .
Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births .
Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available .
Considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high .
Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization .
The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate .
This program is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme , to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women , to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies .
The goal of health programs is to increase the rate of parent security to 49 . percent till 2006 , 55 . percent till 2010 , and 95 percent till 2020 .
The rate of childbirth security to 60 percent till 2006 , 80 percent till 2010 and institutional childbirths has increased to the maximum .
Main works under the Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Main works being run under the program are as follows .
Organisation of R . . . camps .
Organisation of R . . . Outdoor sessions .
Appointment of women health workers on contract .
Comprehensive construction work and repairing of health units .
Urban Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Appointment of supplementary A . . . on contract .
Appointment of 258 supplementary A . . . on contract basis in the unserved and rural areas has been made to increase the immunisation of mothers and children and the acceptability of contraceptives .
On the directions of the Government of India service is being made available at 39 PHCs and 26 CHCs with the goal to provide secure childbirth from 8 o'clock at night to 7 o'clock in the morning at PHCs and CHCs .
900 untrained midwives have been trained in Uttarakhand in the year of 2001-2002 and 2002-03 to provide services of safe labor to pregnant mothers .
560 untrained midwives have been trained in the year of 2004-2005 .
5 Safe Maternity Counsellors  Women Medical Officer  were accepted to be appointed by the Government of India on a contract basis under the E . . . scheme .
After the advertisements in newspapers for appointment three women medical officers were selected out of which only 1 women medical officer has reported her contribution at Agastyamuni CHC of district Rudraprayag .
Care of the health of women and children and vaccination is being done on a village council level by organising an Outreach Session on a defined day  Saturday  by women health workers at the level of each village council in the state .
The said program has been scrapped by the Govt . of India since July , 2004 .
But the above mentioned program is being run in the state with the help of women health workers .
Medicines are being bought at the state level under the RCH program .
RCH kits are being provided directly to the districts by the Government of India .
For equipments bought at the level of the state the provision is to purchase after the recommendation of the Executive Committee constituted at the state level by the Purchase Committee constituted at the level of the Head Office .
Special work has been done in districts in the year of 2003-2004 for propagation of NSV  without cut , without stitch  method to increase the participation men in population stabilisation .
Population stabilisation , installation of stable RN hoarding , wall paintings , orientation of the members of the Panchayati Raj and medical and paramedical staff from the medical department and other media exhibition etc . were done .
Leprosy is a bacteria born contagious disease .
The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae .
Microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin .
Incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly .
Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally .
The M . . . medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society .
All the leprosy patients are not contagious .
Most of the patients are non-contagious who can not spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious .
Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles . . . etc .
About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them .
The main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows .
A light yellow or discolored reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness . . . the spot has no feeling of pain , inflammation , itching or piercing or cold and hot .
Oily shine on the skin .
Thickness of cyst on skin , eyebrows , chin , ears .
Do not do any hard work for three months after the operation of hernia .
Thrilling sensation , numbness or dryness in hands or feet .
Occurrence of deformation in the fingers of hands or feet .
Initiation and spread of leprosy .
Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb .
If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication .
If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing .
Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly .
Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage .
Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients .
Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines .
Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood .
Malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito .
Female anopheles mosquitoes get born in clean water and bites at night .
Fever along with shivering and cold comes often the third day .
You must change water collected in pots at home once a week .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard oil on open parts of the body .
Install fine nets on windows of house .
Do not let water collect near yourself .
If this is not possible then pour some petro-lubricants oil on the collected water .
The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent .
Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible .
Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months .
Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin .
Besides this , loose motion , stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction .
In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10-12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period .
During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well .
After this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease .
The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease .
Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining .
Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth .
Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps .
Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths .
Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while .
The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules . The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children .
About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly .
When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened .
Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR .
MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine .
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective .
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life .
Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy .
However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme .
The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles .
Therefore now it is recommended by both W . . . and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles .
Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel .
Such a system of brain is called mental disorder .
It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease .
It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill .
Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality .
Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease .
Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries .
It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up .
Not paying attention to any work .
Being sad without any reason .
Getting angry very soon , very often .
Change in mood very soon , being sorry from happiness and getting happy again .
Getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children .
Thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong .
Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana .
Problem in desire or the process of copulation .
Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen  in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen  and then his physical and mental test is done .
If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done .
Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods .
Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health .
Encouraging the patient to change emotionally .
Making people aware by propagating for mental health through press . . . radio , health fairs , posters , banners etc in every district .

Saving a mental patient from falling ill again .
The following is be executed in the state under the mental health program .
State Mental Health Authority has been constituted in the state since 4 April , 2002 .
A 30 bed State Mental Hospital is being constructed at Dehradun under the Mental Health Authority program .
Two districts of Uttarakhand have been chosen under the District Mental Health Programme .
Dehradun in the Garhwal division and Nainital in the Kumaun division .
For which a proposal of 184 . 30 lac has been sent to the Government of India .
This program will be implemented in both the districts of Dehradun and Nainital .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme has been transferred from Social Welfare Department to Health Welfare Department since 14 . . 2001 by the Government of India .
The process of transfer is now complete .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme is being implemented by the Health Department in the state of Uttarakhand .
Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs . 500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition .
The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows .
The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services .
A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level .
The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18 .
There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas .
More than three fourth of the women  78 percent  in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so .
A little more than one third  39 percent  of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills .
In cases of tetanus Toxoid injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T . . however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent .
Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service .
Indicating pregnant women .
Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases .
There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand .
This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives .
Even in urban areas more than half  56 percent  of childbirths takes place at home .
In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives .
Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth  14 percent  is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months .
Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post-childbirth services .
Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion .
A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table .
The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans .
This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person .
However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth .
Polio disease particularly attacks young children .
80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age .
Polio is an extremely contagious disease .
Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities .
Oral Poliovirus Vaccine  OPV  was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union .
As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries .
The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world .
The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful .
Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help .
By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis .
Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose .
Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less .
Sex related diseases are contagious diseases . This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse .
This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy .
Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy .
Sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful .
The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia .
Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment .
Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all .
Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children .
Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen  between naval and the reproductive organs  .
Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women .
Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting .
Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs .
If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them .
Dead birth due to inborn syphilis .
The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases .
Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction .
Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye .
Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease .
The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease .
Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs .
Keep away from uncommon sexual relations .
Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse .
HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases .
It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities .
Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed .
Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment .
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease .
Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis .
The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex .
A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year .
About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases .
Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes .
This disease is found commonly in the lungs .
In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease .
Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much .
The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much . People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done .
In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis .
According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year .
The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India .
Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac .
In comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in India .
The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined .
This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis .
In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times .
Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy .
Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis  of the lungs  .
The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm .
The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing .
The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis .
Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary .
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested .
Tuberculosis can be completely cured .
If the patient does the treatment regularly .
There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment .
Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy .
In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers .
Which is called DOTS  Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy  .
As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker .
There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis .

The knot can be of normal color or else of black color .
In preliminary stage the knot is painless and because of this reason we commit grave mistake .
Because of no pain in the knot the patient does not give attention to the treatment of the knot .

With cancer infested skin healthy skin is also removed by cutting because of which chance of cancer being left back ends .
At times lymph glands are also cut and removed with cancerous skin .
It depends on the rapidity of cancer whether the cancerous glands should be cut and removed or not .
The cancer of the skin of the reproductive organs is different from the cancer of skin of other organs .
Other diseases of reproductive organs increase due to hesitation and their proper treatment does not take place .

If the cancer has spread up to lymph glands then the lymph gland is also cut and taken out .
Definitely get every knot occurring on the skin checked up .

Days back a surprising report taking up mental problems was published in a national level newspaper .
According to the report , approximately one fourth of the population of the country suffers from some or the other type of mental problems in their lifetime .
This matter can not be completely true but to consider it a guess will also not be correct .
In order to search luxury and comfort man may be making progress by leaps and bounds but his brain has to bear a lot of harms for this .
Old and aged , children , everyone is suffering from various types of mental tension and are coming in the captivities of psychological disorders .
Even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists .
But the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier .
The advice of the psychologists is proving ineffective and modern medicines which suppress the symptoms of the problem are delivering more harm .
In the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient Indian medical science , that is , Ayurveda .
The cure , analysis and treatment of psychological disorders are discussed in detail in Ayurvedic texts .
Maharishi Charak tells about three types of diseases in sutrasthan of ' Charak Samhita ' . . nij 2 . aagantu 3 . maanas .
The Nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders  gas , bile , cough  .
Aagantu diseases are those which occur due to ghosts  microbes  , polluted air and maanas diseases are those psychological disorders which occur due to desires and jealousy .
As all of you know , Ayurveda is not just the method of treatment , it is also a science of life .
In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy .
The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body .
If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected .
Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body .
There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it .
The nature of man , his judgement and decisive ability , the multiplicity of his character till the extent of the entire personality depends on these three properties of saatvik , rajsik and tamsik properties .
If there is increase in the rajsik and tamsik properties in man due to his food and life style then he can be surrounded with psychological disorders .
According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence .
Desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride .
Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all .
With the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence , the mental balance disrupts , mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as a result psychological disorders occur .
According to ` Charak samhita ' , in the case of mental disorders , negative effects affect the eight basic psychological causes of will - will , intelligence , memory , feeling , devotion , morality , efforts and behavior .
Due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life .
With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders .
This is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food , excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in Ayurveda .
Renowned Yoga and spiritual Deepak Chopra considers ' radiation and life ' also important together with brilliance for mental health .
According to Dr . Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body .
Radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision .
Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders .
One main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike a proper balance with his surroundings .
In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc .
If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc .
The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now .
Dr . Deepak Chopra says . the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body ' .
In the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain .
In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain .
Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice .
After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery .
He had also heard something about hernia .
According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc .
Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur .
The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct .
Surgery is its only cure and the more the delay the more increased would be the discomfort .
After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away .
He got the surgery done afterwards according to his physician ' s consultation or stayed in the maze of third or fourth opinion . do not have any information of this .
It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan .
Like the disease hernia construction of a saclike creation takes place from the swelling of tissues in any particular organ of the patient due to genetic or any other reason .
Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach .
That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach .
But in the essay we will discuss in the context of hernia of stomach .
There are three main kinds of this type of hernia too - inguinal hernia affecting the groin region , umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach .
Inguinal Hernia : This is a swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia .
The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia .
It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction .
The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common .
Umbilical hernia is related to stomach .
Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia .
Umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders .
In fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth .
In some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center .
If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years .
Large sized hernia which does not stop on their own , surgery is important for their treatment .
This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child .
In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth .
But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak .
Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high .
Incisional hernia . large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach .
Due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common .
Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high .
2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type .
Due to the reason of the permanent weakening of walls of stomach there is a chance for hernia to occur once more for second time through surgery .
One of the main causes of hernia to occur is the weakening of walls of stomach .
This problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons , due to increasing age , as a result of surgery , strain in muscles during pregnancy , reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity , diseases like marfan syndrome etc .
Excessive pressure inside the stomach is also built due to growth of hydrosil , growth of tumor in uterus , due to pregnancy , etc . because of which the walls of stomach become weak and the danger of hernia increases .
It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia .
During the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise .
In affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur .
Swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight , micturition or defecation .
Swelling becomes clearly visible in some cases by staying standing for long or coughing as well .
The pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense .
The intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends .
It is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia .
Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc .
Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor .
Where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or CAT scan done .
The aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil .
The only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself .
Riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery .
Famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy , endoscopy etc .
In some cases open surgery is also done .
For the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days , that surgery is laparoscopy .
Due to being minimal invasive surgery , the surgery is done by putting an incision of only 2 . mm to the patient .
As a result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery .
He gets working in normal way after just two - three days of surgery and within 5 to 7 days he gets to his daily works .
Under this technique of surgery . laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through a small tube .
Surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen .
By means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia .
The rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach .
A netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem .
With the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost a completely safe process .
Yes , in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen .
Generally during hernioplasty there is a danger of infection in the region of surgery , destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs , etc .
Where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there a well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in a better way in case of complication .
As I told you earlier , the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe .
But from fear of surgery or considering hernia as a less serious disease can put the patient ' s life at risk .
It is worth mentioning that hernia is such a problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time .
If it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult .
In the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene .
Because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops .
Consequently tightness , vomiting , release of gas , actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential .
In some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing .

Diabetes is not a disease which happens only to aged and obese people .
The treatment of diabetes mellitus  sugar found in urine  occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition .
In diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas .
Diabetes is of two types .
At some point of time type 1 diabetes was called ' juvenile onset diabetes ' .
This is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all . because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas .
This disease may occur with great speed in the age of 6 to 13 years .
In type 2 diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it .
This disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family .
Type 2 diabetes grows gradually .
The symptoms of Type 2 diabetes are frequent micturition , drinking lots of water , dryness of throat , laziness , high pulse rate and blurred vision .
The cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar  more than 126 mg  .
For the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in a day .
In such situation they can get great relief from counselling .
You should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not a disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other .
In order to keep the balance of blood sugar level OK the insulin has to be balanced and for this make the children exercise daily .
Together with this give him food of this type which has little carbohydrate , balanced quantity of fat , more fiber and less sodium 6 times a day little by little .
The teachers , family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease .
The young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle .
For this they should reform the eating pattern , reduce weight and do exercise .
Keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self - dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth .
He can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of 10 years of age .
When does eye problem occur .
If your child has a problem in doing school work .
If he feels pain in eyes , throbbing pain or tiredness .
He does not see the writing on the black board clearly .
If he brings his book very close to eyes while reading the book .
Then take him to an eye specialist immediately .
Often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious .
Important information connected to antibiotic .
If your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for 48 hours then follow his advice .
If you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for 5 days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of 5 days .
This way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases , consequently that problem can again start to grow .

Our brain of around 1 . to 1 . kilogram weight seems to be made of soft matter of brown color .
Our brain is in fact a complex mass of thousand crore of nerve cells only .
The brain of small honeybee is also made up of these cells only .
One unit of brain , neuron or nerve cell is complete and independent in itself .
Every nerve cell has a long tail .
This tail is as small as 1 mm in some , then in others it is as long as thousand mm or one metre .
The brain is an infinite maze of several thousand crores of cells and the mutual network between them .
On the whole either the pregnancy does not stay in women suffering from tumor or even if it stays then many more complications occur during pregnancy .
Like abortion , premature delivery , premature rupture of the amniotic fluid sac , dislocation of placenta  premature  , weakening of the foetus in the womb , the foetus getting crossed , inverted or skewed .
The child getting stuck at the time of delivery .
The need of caesarean operation for the delivery .
Complications while the operation , need to remove the uterus .
Excessive bleeding post delivery .
Getting anaemic owing to excessive bleeding .
Increase in the size of fibroid .
Many times the cure of uterine glandular swelling is problematic .
The size of uterus also increases in ovarine knot-endometriosis , pregnancy edinomyosis etc . but a skilful gynaecologist can easily find out the disease after a careful examination .
The following tests are important for fibroid .
Sonography through abdomen or vagina  transabdominal and transvaginal  .
Laparoscopy , hysteroscopy . . . .  if needed  .
HIV  if the doctor thinks essential  .
After finding out the condition of fibroid in the uterus with these tests , it can be ascertained by which method it can be removed .
Mere presence of the glandular swelling is not a prerequisite for its removal .
If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory .
There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary .
If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed .
If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy .
The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers .
There are two types of operations for fibroid .
Myomactomy  removal of knot only  , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy  opening stomach  .
Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children .
Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor .
Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia .
Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid .
GnRH analog  decapeptyl or lupride  , mifepristone , danazol are the main medicines .
But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced .
The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine .
The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis  through laser Nd-YYAG  .
The blocking of uterine artery  ambolization  .
In modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through a pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it .
By blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to 60 % .
A skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything .
Therefore , it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease .
The investigation of the secrets of brain .
If we gradually cut open with a saw and separate the upper part of the skull of a man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes .
Similarly , neuro-surgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill .
Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria  bacilli  .
Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it .
Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein . . . Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas .
By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity .
On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell .
In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm .
Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment .
The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India .
In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell .
In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner .
By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them .
The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells .
In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell .
The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two .
Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington .
How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell .
There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse . Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine .
Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded .
After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system .
What is the benefit of this : The question is in fact very interesting and important .
If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard .
Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only .
In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire .
But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell .
Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction .
Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos .
The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1 . milli second .
This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time .
The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them .
Synapse has one more use as well .
Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain .
These chemical substances are called medicines .
Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only .
Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult .
Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses .
The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery .
Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually .
Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory .
From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts .
Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body .
Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important .
Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones .
At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body .
Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles .
The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything .
For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect .
We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger .
This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord .
The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only .
Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone .
The entire caravan of all the signals between brain and different parts of the body crosses through this spinal cord alone .
Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious .
But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord .
The brain starts just as we enter the head .
Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain .
On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch .
Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts .
One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it .
In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively .
The lowest most part is medulla oblongata , very small and common in appearance but very special in importance .
The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone .
Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc. .
A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment .
But there is nothing to get scared in this .
Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head .
At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged .
The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death .
The same happens when the criminals are hanged .
Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well .
The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc . bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs .
If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come .
Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction .
In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway .
Similarly 3 branches go to the cerebellum  mini brain  located at the back of brain-stem .
Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs .
First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags .
We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward .
Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely .
Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions .
Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla .
Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain .
Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face .
Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain .
On crossing this line one gets to feel a very important difference .
From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state .
From darkness to light .
We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum .
As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep .
But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake .
We start feeling comfort , sadness .
We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine .
We start saying I am there . am doing . am liking it .
Does any machine feel like this .
None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours .
Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see .
The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both .
And why should not it be  After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc. .
While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body .
But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man .
Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain .
Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body .
Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours .
The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram .
The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body .
If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale .
There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now .
This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres .
There is a very small bridge connecting the two - corpus callosum .
Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body .
All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side .
This very system is found in all the organisms .
The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body .
Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere .
Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner .
The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only .
In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread .
The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle .
The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing .
The system of olfaction is at the lower surface .
Though this part in man has become very unimportant in comparison to animals like dogs .
But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain .
Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves .
So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum .
Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain .
This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed .
Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone .
The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up .
What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely .
It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery .
A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come .
Touch , heat , pressure , pricking everything is felt here only .
But how this : We feel pain in finger when thorn pricks , but not in head .
But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed .
Then only we realize pain .
The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger .
Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system .
If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted .
Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment .
We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like .
This is called paralysis .
Nothing has happened to the muscles , not even to the motor cortex .
Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut .
Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain .
Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs .
In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life .
We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires . and brain .
Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer .
Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations .
We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers .
Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction .
But are the methods of both same .
In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us .
Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate .
Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance .
In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well .
Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way .
Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model .
In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc . so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these .
Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain .
We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again .
The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off .
But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work .
What does this mean . am tired , leave . will not do anymore .
If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer .
The child soon gets bored with useless work .
There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer .
He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before .
Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it .
Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin .
One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer .
Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking .
The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this .
Thus it is also called spoonerism .
At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain .
If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions .
It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach .
In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it .
But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness .
The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil .
The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second .
Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five .
That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer .
Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them .
Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects .
In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only .
The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette .
But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken .
Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges .
No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn .
Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them .
Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain .
Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum .
Therefore these have the maximum importance in man .
By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other .
Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education .
Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language .
First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant .
Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it .
Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain .
Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks .
It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain .
Can the present human society be imagined without language .
Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing .
Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them .
In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain .
While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them .
When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side .
The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results .
Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually .
In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him .
Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body .
But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres .
Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal .
In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous .
The same thing has also been seen in all the animals .
It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere .
But when Roger Sperry severed the contact between the two hemispheres then how special is the place of each in our mental activities was estimated for the first time .
If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this .
Left hemisphere - language  speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard  , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time .
Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space .
Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division .
But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed .
On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite .
Whatever one cerebral hemisphere learns the other does not get to know anything about that .
As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded .
The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin .
With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments .
One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth .
In any huge class some students would be uncommon .
That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand .
These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket .
What is their ratio in your school or classroom .
In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability .
If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect .
But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale .
To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this .
Breast cancer is a scary name for women .
Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days .
Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer .
The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery .
If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent .
This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture .
In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits .
Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible .
In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography .
In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays .
Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body .
Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800 .
But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine .
On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light .
In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately .
This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ .
Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments .
Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed .
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment .
Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important .
Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography .
Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography .
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc. .
Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases .
Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease .
Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD .
Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS .
There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections .
STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus .
Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following .
HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease .
HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations .
The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex .
HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women .
On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck .
For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible .
Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms .
Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained .
But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief .
Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners .
Genital herpes is of two types .
After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain .
Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching .
Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge .
In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners .
Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection .
If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby .
Syphilis is a bacterial infection .
Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals .
Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child .
In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain .
At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all .
Many times people ignore it .
These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going .
Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years .
Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack .
Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection .
If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child .
For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also .
Get the infection checked at regular intervals .
If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done .
With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours .
Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite .
The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women .
Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom .
There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men .
But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis .
Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly .
According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial .
For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased .
Health and regular check up .
Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards .
Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years .
The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap .
It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years .
The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years .
But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years .
Pap test is of two types .
Leukoria test is done to find about common infections .
Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations .
Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal .
Pap infection test is also of two types .
One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled .
Second . hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection .
With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not .
The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years .
The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years .
Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer .
Liquid pap test is done for this .
Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast .
According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it .
According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up .
Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year .
Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam .
Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years .
Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion .
The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it .
Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important .
The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time .
After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done .
With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test .
After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not .
Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done .
Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health .
They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper .
There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution .
The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started .
In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause .
Pelvic exam test must be done annually .
With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known .
If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test .
One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years .
If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done .
Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40 .
Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years .
After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity .
Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs .
Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery .
Bone densitometry is also done for calcium .
By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out .
After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women .
Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important .
Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer .
Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test .
After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc . is coming in your stomach or not .
Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years .
By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs .
Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years .
That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age .
There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval .
These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity  fatness  .
Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes .
If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times .
Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled .
If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast .
It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need .
If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken .
Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting .
This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today .
Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure .
If the pressure on them is constantly very high then it would have a bad effect on their walls .
As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys .
But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high .
Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure .
If you take two simple roller pumps in place of the two halves of the heart auricle and ventricle then you can do the entire task of the heart .
Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body .
Both the main arteries open in the right auricle .
If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing .
One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries .
In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty .
Medical surgery does this only .
If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead .
Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification .
Artificial lungs are also a very simple apparatus .
A glass vessel full of blood in which oxygen is released in the form of bubbles .
There is a special arrangement so that lather do not form by the bubbles of oxygen .
Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going .
Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible .
The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body .
The heart too needs fuel for its work .
The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers .
Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches .
Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart .
The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart .
The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown .
On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack .
The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography .
These days there is discussion about ultrasonography .
But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century .
It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released .
Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG .
In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back .
Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate .
With its help proper treatment is done by doing medical cure .
The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother .
But it is not like that .
Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated .
Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated .
For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important .
Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery .
Liver is a very important organ of the body .
The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them .
The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound .
Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound .
The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart .
Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive .
Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test .
Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful .
The problem of thyroid gland is also very common .
For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity .
The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG .
One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer .
It is believed that U . . . mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography .
It gives cure in 75-90 % cases .
USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity .
The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere .
Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus .
Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it  hydrocephalous  etc. .
Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems .
Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta .
The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta .
By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc. .
By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus .
By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine .
Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs .
So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work .
Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus .
In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons .
Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight .
Cataract disease is connected to age and often this makes the people who are more than 50 years of age as its victims .
On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth .
The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries .
According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract .
Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery .
The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases .
This is called white cataract .
In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles .
After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles .
At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery .
To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique .
To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made .
Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye .
Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye .
Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this .
Thus , it is called the suture less surgery .
The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day .
He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months .
The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care .
To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs .
One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes .
One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument .
Expensive machines are used in the technique of phaco emulsification .
Therefore . phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries .
Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract .
The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time .
You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part .
Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus .
More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number .
Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that .
But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery .
The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well .
In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves .
The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine .
Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure .
If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray .
Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process .
The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection .
The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number .
Generally this is done in one episode .
One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body .
When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced .
Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain .
Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment .
As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours .
Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months .
Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not .
Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered .
Of course , in complications immediately after treatment bleeding in urine and feeling of intense pain in 1-2 micturition are included .
Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis .
In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more .
The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor .
Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country .
In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision .
You can start the normal daily life in a week .
The action can be repeated if the stone forms again .
The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease .
The problem of uncontrolled micturition .
in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening .
The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small .
Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine .
Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only .
They stop wetting clothes and bed .
Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women .
It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years . to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more .
The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women .
Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment .
The complication of not having control on urination , the problem of leaking on its own may occur due to the reason of diseases of urinary system or the various diseases of organs situated close to it .
Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes .
The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage .
If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled .
This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder .
But in several women its cause is not diagnosed .
This problem may occur in some due to mental tension .
Women often try to control urine for long time .
The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less .
Clothes may also be spoiled by not having control due to some structural defects in urinary bladder  urinary tract .
If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum  fistula  or genitals then also the problem may arise .
There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery .
Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible .
The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests .
To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken .
The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause .
If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast .
If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery .
If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it .
If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved .
If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery .
If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity .
Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it .
Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive .
If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done .
Do exercise of pelvis and stomach .
Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination .
Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health .
Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry .
In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing .
If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis .
Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients .
If these increases the will power in patients then also relief may be got from the problems .
These patients get relief in 80 % by using the instrument placed close to the genitals by which the lower part of the urinary bladder gets support .
Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube .
If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery .
Because of not having control over urination in the state of hyperactivity of urinary bladder , women stay in haste , their urine can leak .
This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination .
If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential .
If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination .
Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it .
Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves .
If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained .
Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves .
Many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems .
They are advised to take anti-cholinergic or anti-depressant medicines .
Problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder , obstruction in passage , damage of the nervous system , consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension , may be the reasons of habit .
By finding the root cause treatment should be done .
If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery .
Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this .
The complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in 20 to 40 % adult females .
But the problem is not untreatable , women can become problem free by changing the life style , habits , doing exercise of hips and pelvis , medicine , treatment by surgery and other techniques .
Therefore these should not hesitate , should not feel embarrassed , should lead a healthy , normal life after getting treated by taking advice from a skilled doctor .
This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly .
The complaint of urine infection can occur both in men and women but this complaint is found more in women because the inner part of their genitals stays open .
Slight dirt , showing carelessness in hygiene , wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person .
Therefore , every person should stay beware of it .
The women should especially pay more attention to the hygiene of their body .
Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once .
When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52 .
After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much .
The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort .
In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation .
The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever .
In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube .
The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E . Coli bacteria .
The occurrence of urinary infection in females may be a common thing but it is quite shameful and uncomfortable .
Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible .
After intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained .
Light , easily digestible food , carrot , papaya , cucumber , gourd , guava etc should be eaten a lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation .
Lots of water should be consumed .
The cancer of skin is generally of three types .
Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer .
The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above .
While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous .
The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor .
This tumor can appear on any part of the body .
Like hand , leg , face etc. .
The tumor can be of normal color or of black color .
In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor .
Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor .
When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer .
Which has spread in other parts of the body as well .
At times cancer appears in the form of a small wound .
The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain .
The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain .
The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that .
But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body .
At times cancer appears in hairless tumors .
Therefore , do not forget any tumor .
No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known .
Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms .
Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor .
If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor .
Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful .
Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body .
Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin .
If a tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor , getting tested is a must .
If pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done .
If wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important .
Each such wound appearing on the skin , which does not get healed in 2 weeks , signals towards cancer .
Generally , the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone .
Therefore , generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed .
The skin of the place which has cancer , from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands .
Treatment of the cancer of the skin : along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed .
By which the danger of cancer being left back is removed .
At times , along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed .
It depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not .
Carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound , towards warts and painless tumor , towards genitals .
The cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs .
Although the beginning of cancer starts just with a tiny tumor or wound , but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late .
At times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals .
Not only cancer but other diseases of genitals also continues to grow due to hesitation and its proper treatment does not take place .
In the condition of cancer of female genitals : the skin of the genitals are cut and removed .
If the cancer has spread up to the lymph glands then the lymph glands also have to be cut and removed .
The meaning of arthritis is ` swelling of the joints ' and more than 100 different types of swelling of joints have been put under the category of arthritis .
Arthritis disease can take in its captive at any age .
Arthritis disease is seen in children as well .
The arthritis disease is a common thing in people of 50 years and more .
The arthritis disease in them occurs in grim condition and is more painful .
As the age increases , the cases of arthritis also increase and 3 out of every 5 people have been seen as the patients of arthritis in the age group of less than 65 .
If the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis is not done in time then by this a lot of harm occurs to the joints and bones of the body .
In fact arthritis is a disease affecting the women world over .
Which along with being a shock absorber also reduces the friction of the bones .
But in the patients of arthritis , this cartilage weakens due to abrasion or else gets fully damaged because of which intense pain in the joints , weakness is felt and swelling also occurs .
Because of the damage to this cartilage the arthritis infested patient faces difficulties in activities like walking , climbing up the stairs and sitting down or taking bath by sitting on the ground .
Generally if there is persisting pain in joints of knees , elbows , ankles , shoulders , neck , hands etc . and if there is intense pain in normal activities like walking , getting up from the chair , bending while working or bending to pick something from down then the signal of this matter should be understood that the time to consult the doctor has come .
Because of arthritis not just there is swelling and stiffness in the joints but several times redness is also seen in the joints .
If the correct diagnosis of arthritis is done in time then relief from the disease is possible to a very great extent .
The meaning of quick treatment is less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain .
Generally the advice of surgery is also given when the arthritis becomes serious .
Similarly the patients in whom arthritis has reached the initial stage .
For them the options like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial .
In condition of arthritis affecting the entire joint the total hip replacement  TKR  is useful .
The meaning of TKR is not this that a metal implant is fixed by removing the knee of the patient .
In fact in the TKR procedure a new layer is put at the end of the bones .
In this way the knee becomes totally safe and complete bending and bowing becomes possible .
Knee transplant is the latest technique in which the patient gets relief in various activities like walking , bending while gardening , sitting while driving or exercising , climbing up and down the stairs .
In the context of our country it takes new meanings as well because the joints have important role in several types of daily activities like bending or sitting on the floor .
Bending up to 155 degree is possible by high flexion knees and the patient can again come back to his daily routine .
The patients who have already got the rotating platform high flexion knee transplant today experience much more satisfaction and they can finish their daily activity in a much better way .
The riddance from an epidemic like arthritis can be obtained by proper medical care , options of surgery and by adopting balanced life style and proper habits .
And the patient does not have to undergo the suffering condition of pain and decrease in the physical activities .
Apart from medicine and surgery balanced diet also plays an important role in combating with this disease in a better way .
The important things which should be kept in mind in matters of food are as follows .
Increase the quantities of vitamins , minerals , antioxidants and nutritive substances and by doing this you can keep your weight under control .
The state of arthritis becomes severe by the increase of obesity .
Consume more and more of fresh fruits and vegetables and especially eat more VitaminC rich fruits like apples , oranges , cherry , peppers , tomatoes , beet root , sweet potato etc so that the joints stay protected .
With fibrous food like whole grain , barley and brown rice also one gets help in maintaining health and especially joints .
Refrain from taking fried food .
Consume more and more of calcium rich food  like diary products , dry fruits , soya milk , fish  etc. .
Calcium rich food keep the bones safe .
Eat such food by which Vitamin D stays in the body .
Our body does not produce calcium , that is obtained from food .
By doing regular exercise also the muscles around the joints become strong .
The density of bones increase by this and the abrasion of joints also decrease .
The habit of alcohol spoils the life of the best of men .
Being irritated of their habit the family members constantly keep trying that from anywhere they should get such a treatment by which the addiction of the drunkard turned member can be removed .
At times this situation is such that the drunkard on getting fed up of his own bad habit thinks of quitting alcohol .
In such situations they start seeking support of such solutions by which they get harmed in place of being profited .
Even after having different types of treatment they get sadness alone .
Help is also taken from the rehabilitation centres but there is limit also for those who help in coming out of the cyclone of intoxication .
In getting rid of the intoxication of alcohol will power of the drunkard works more than treatment .
Even if the family members of the drunkard take him forcibly to the alcohol rehabilitation center and there his treatment is started , his treatment would not be successful till the time he himself develops the desire within himself that he has to quit alcohol .
Naltrekson is such chemical which block the opioid receptors situated in the brain responsible for the feeling of happiness received from intoxication after drinking alcohol .
Apart from taking naltrekson in the form of oral tablets it can also be taken in the form of injection .
But it has been proved by the experiments that taking injection is more effective .
Since naltrekson is intoxication preventive in the purest form therefore till the time it is there in the body no type of excitement would be felt by him on doing any type of intoxication .
The special mixture of naltrekson is made to reach 3-4 metres beneath the skin by making an incision of 1 cm in the lower part of the stomach or behind the arm .
The benefit in this condition is this that on not taking the medicine by the patient or on forgetting to eat medicine the medicine continues to show its effect .
In naltrekson implant also it is important that the patient is kept under the naltrekson treatment for at least 12 months .
Often it happens that those who get oral treatment done they stop the treatment in middle .
While the treatment should last for at least 1 year , along with it the quantity of alcohol is also reduced .
One can get harmed by the consumption of any intoxicating item be it alcohol or smack or any other intoxicating item with naltrekson implant .
In bacterial dysentery the body becomes weak after becoming skinny and fever starts developing .
In the extreme case of bacterial dysentery there is repeated tendency of releasing fecus in the patient but each time very less fecus is discharged .
In bacterial dysentery together with discharge of fecus , vomiting also takes place and the patient feels extremely thirsty .
In bacterial dysentery the tongue gets dried , extreme deficiency of water molecules and the symptoms of food poisoning becomes visible .
In the fecus of the patient of amoebic dysentery entamoeba hystolytica are found and in the stool test of bacterial dysentery bacteria are found .
In the preventive treatment of bacterial dysentery also it is very important to protect edible and drinking items from the flies .
In order to be safe from the bacterial dysentery the fecal release should be done at a definite place and phenyl should be used regularly at such a place .
The patient suffering from bacterial dysentery should be kept warm in bed .
The fomentation of turpentine on stomach is beneficial in bacterial dysentery .
If contracted bacterial dysentery only boiled water should be used for the first 24 hours .
The other treatments of bacterial dysentery are similar to amoebic dysentery .
Rabies is a viral disease which happens in mammals generally by the biting of dog or other animals .
The central nervous system gets affected by rabies and if not treated immediately the death of the patient is inevitable .
The virus of rabies gradually reaches to the central nervous system through the medium of peripheral nervous system .
The effect of rabies takes up to several months to appear .
On the basis of its location in the uterus it is of three types .
Sub mucous , intramural , sub serous .
This can be one or more than one in number .
Night blindness is a disease of eyes .
When sonography is done because of some other reason then it is found out that there is a tumor in the uterus .
Major among other symptoms of fibroid are .
In day time everything is clearly visible to the patient of night blindness , but at the night time he is not able to see even the nearby things clearly .
In night blindness there is discharge of white color .
In night blindness the eye lens appears to be consisting of minute hole and triangular shape becomes visible behind the cornea .
The care of new born infant .
The infant must be well taken care of at the time of birth .
The nose , throat , mouth , anus etc of the new born baby must be cleaned before it takes the first breath .
Tie the umbilical cord .
The physical investigation of the infant must be done .
For all types of tests for normal conditions post birth like nose , ears , throat , neck , breast , arms , genitals and anus etc should be done .
The new born should be wiped with soft cloth after birth and it must be given bath only after one week .
The infant must be weighed immediately after birth and thereafter it should be given to the mother for breast feeding after wiping it .
The newly born baby must be kept close to the body of the mother .
The child can be saved from hypothermia this way .
The chances of infection in a newly born infant is the maximum , therefore the baby must be saved from infection .
The best way to protect a newly born infant from infection is to lift it after cleaning ones hand with soap beforehand .
Do not take the child to a place where other children are sick .
The role of mother is main in the care of the infant .
The mother should be given the correct information about keeping gap in the birth of next child and the time-table for the inoculations .
Each mother should be educated to identify the symptoms of danger in her child so that she can immediately take her child to the doctor if needed .
If the new born baby is of less weight , is in sick state then it should not be distanced from his mother .
His entire care should be done in front of his parents only .
By parental touch or by taking it in the lap the tension of child decreases .
National Family Planning program was started in the form of sponsored program by the government .
The aim of national family planning program was to keep the population steady in the face of the needs of the national development .
The main aim of the family planning program was to reduce birth rate right from the beginning in order to achieve this aim , for which the various techniques of family planning was to be encouraged in the masses .
The meaning of birth and child health point of view is to accept unanimous and composite view towards the issues of contraception and mother-child health .
Solid methods to control population growth .
Population growth has been the chief problem of the developing countries .
In order to stop population growth immediately very solid steps have to be take .
Firstly , it is needed to attack poverty .
Appropriate success can not be achieved in this direction without removing this factor mainly responsible for population increase in countries like India .
The nation looks infested with scarcity from all the four sides .
Baldness is not a disease .
At present there has been a flood of the centres for treating baldness in big cities .
Generally , hair starts falling due to high fever , typhoid , syphilis , influenza and lack of blood etc. .
Generally baldness is a genetic condition but it begins mostly in the head with the start of itching and irritation .
It has often been seen that the hair of 20-30 year old men falls gradually and after some time they become bald to a great extent .
Therefore it can be prevented in the beginning with safety measures .
It happens very fast in women of less age but the situation of complete baldness arises very less in them .
This is a scientific fact that the hair of healthy people grow everyday and in the place of hair that fall during combing new hair grow on their own from time to time .
Various skin diseases like herpes , ringworm make such a layer on the scalp that the hair starts falling and baldness comes .
The use of cosmetics like oils to prevent hair fall and baldness , the soaps to wash head make such cases even more serious .
Staying in intense light or staying in sunlight for long , special types of beautifying cosmetics and techniques like bleaching and curling of the hair etc . encourage baldness .
Special hair designs in which the hair is twisted and broken and making pony tail especially while sleeping at night and by putting needles and rings in the hair etc may also become the reason of baldness .
Because of deficiency of thyroid the hair start falling by becoming thin , weak and dry .
Along with keeping the body healthy with nutritious food the hair can also be made beautiful dense and strong .
Unbalanced diet not just stops the continuous growth of hair but it also makes bald very fast .
Because of any ups and downs happening in the life hair start falling and complete baldness may also come .
During pregnancy and after pregnancy the falling of hair in women is a common thing .
Tiredness and tension are the chief causes of heart disease so it also has a large impact on body and hair .
Some professions also do not stay away from affecting the hair .
The hair of a thirty year old man in England was found to come out in bunches while his hew hair were also growing .
After the chemical tests it was found that the quantity of mercury was more in his blood vessels because of which his hair used to fall .
It was found after enquiring that mercury was used in the industry in which he was working because of which the mercury slowly diffused into his body gradually .
Because of eating habits the hair often falls .
Because of excessive feelings and being emotional disorders occur in the head and it is natural for the hair to fall .
Increase of weight or obesity is a chief health problem .
Most men-women , be it adults or youth , are tensed with the increasing obesity or increase in weight of their body .
If the increase in weight and obesity becomes a hindrance for the activities of the body then actually it becomes a matter of concern for every person .
Normally , the main symptom of obesity is that the height of the body should be in proportion to the weight of the body .
If the weight is more than the physical height then the body is fat otherwise the body comes in the category of being thin .
Two main reasons of weight and obesity have been told under the health science .
First , genetic meaning by descent .
Second , because of food habits meaning activities related to diet .
Eating more than hunger , not doing exercise or physical labor , leading a life of lethargic etc . come under this .
People who do not do physical labor and exercise , along with the less flow of blood in their body , in places like belly , hips and waist .
Cholesterol  fat  accumulates in the blood carrying vessels as a result of which diseases like high blood pressure , indigestion , heart disease and diabetes occur .
At present as the consciousness of people are increasing towards healthy life and pure and plain healthy diet and exercise people are becoming aware of the dangers owing to increase in weight and obesity .
The diseases owing to obesity are also becoming a subject of concern for people .
Advice of reducing weight and obesity is given by the doctors to the patients of high blood pressure , diabetes and heart disease .
The women escape from food which increase weight and obesity and practice self control in order to keep their body slim and attractive .
It is generally seen that in order to reduce the weight of the body and not to let obesity come the lasses take very less food under dieting and do unnecessary exercise .
By doing unnecessary exercise several times harmful effects are seen on the body .
The other problem which comes by this is that if the weight of the body is more or less than required then along with ill effects on health weakness may also arise in the body .
In the report released by World Health Organisation , it was indicated in 2002 that among the ten chief dangers for health the biggest danger is that of the reduced weight .
If the weight of the body reduces without dieting or without exercise then this also is considered to be the symptom of a serious disease .
It is important to take the advice of the doctor prior to dieting .
It is essential for the body to get complete nutrition according to the daily needs because of which it can work well and there should not be any weakness .
The following matters have to be paid attention to in this context .
The harmony between food and habits is a must then only the effort towards the direction of reducing weight  obesity becomes meaningful .
The body construction and the food related needs of every human being is different according to his actions .
Copying someone or comparing oneself with the other is waste .
Some food items like fast  junk food , fried substances come under the food of negative calorie .
The hunger does get satiated by eating food items like fast  junk food .
But the body does not get any benefit from this .
Gradually one should try to evade it by strong will power .
Dieting is done by several girls and women to reduce their obesity and weight .
Positive results of reducing obesity come forward .
The person who is dieting should diet after taking proper consultation .
There are many dangerous diseases in the present world - TB , Malaria , disease of heart , Cancer , Tension and HIV etc. .
These diseases are more dangerous than SARS , These diseases have caused the death of more people in comparison to SARS .
Then also SARS has attracted the attention of more and more people .
There are many similarities and difficulties in SARS and other diseases .
It is important here that SARS has emerged as a new problem , this is a new disease which is non-curable .
SARS is spreading due to infection .
SARS today is the synonym of that disease which occurs due to corona virus .
Because of SARS disease the infected person gets high  104 degree Fahrenheit  fever .
Dry cough starts coming and there is difficulty in breathing .
SARS is called hyper active respiratory syndrome .
The initial symptoms of SARS resemble pneumonia .
But if SARS is not diagnosed in time or there is carelessness in treatment then death takes place .
The history of SARS is not very old .
The recognition of the disease was done for the first time in China .
The first patient was discovered in aeroplane on February 26 , 2003 .
The symptoms of the patient infected with SARS are illusionary .
The infected person gets fever of 104 degree Fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this .
Headache and vomiting starts happening .
Breathing becomes difficult in the patient .
The symptoms like pneumonia appear .
The one who is attacked dies in three - six days .
In the whole world there is a situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of SARS .
Thus , Suspect Case and Probable Case have been defined .
The formula to stay constantly healthy .
Uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere .
By the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body .
At times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or cough-cold or any other disease or allergy .
With food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body .
Such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach .
If by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food .
After all why does it happen that in similar situations some people fall sick while some other people continue to be healthy .
How does the immune system work .
At first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents .
A type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes .
The nature protects us by other means as well .
Our mouth , nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes .
The saliva in the mouth is antibacterial .
A layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs .
The microbes which do not die immediately , they become inactive on sticking with the mucous .
There is a type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called ` lysosome ' .
Lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria .
The beneficial bacteria named ` lactobacillus ' staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes .
This way our immunity works as a protective shield against the mischief of just any disease causing microbe .
If by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria , virus , fungus , parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins .
The scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system .
The cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body .
The cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity .
There are three main types of cells - red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes , white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is , the cells which coagulate the blood .
Worm - this is a common disease in children .
Objectively the worms are of several types - round worm , magnetic worm , thread worm , tape worm and other diseases of worm .
Round worm affects children the most .
The symptoms of round worm .
Less hunger , stomach pain , mild fever , chattering of teeth , micturition in bed , cough , itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms .
At times the round worms come together as a unit and produce obstruction in the intestines .
Because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting .
The hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there .
The eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood .
The round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing .
The eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body .
Tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat .
Their diagnosis is possible by stool examination .
Similarly , naru is also a type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds , lakes , tanks etc. .
The water in rural areas is generally available from these sources only .
Thus , naru disease is generally found more in rural population .
The naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the Cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow .
The worm generally produces a wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water .
In such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water .
The symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body .
The part of the body where the worms come out , there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then a hole forms .
Because of this the symptoms of high fever , headache and vomiting appear .
In order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks , lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering .
The diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow .
The disease which spread through the microbes related to water .
In this disease several types of malaria , filaria , dengue and yellow fever etc . are included .
The disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through a total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum , plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria .
In the symptoms of malaria there is high fever , nausea , headache and very profuse sweating .
By affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death .
Generally the mosquitoes bite at night .
The disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night .
Dengue , yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys .
Aedes Aegypti mosquito spreads yellow fever mainly in the urban regions by communicating virus from one person to the body of another person .
In the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate , fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water .
But its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run .
Or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite .
This nitrite again reacts with diamine , amide and carbonate and forms n-nitroso compound which is very cancerous .
For the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important .
On consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water , many types of disease occur in man and cattle .
The disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called ` fluorosis ' .
Polio eradication program : problem and solution .
Polio is such a disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life .
In this disease affecting in childhood generally , the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin .
Consequently polio infested person has to walk as a lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life .
Often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further .
The reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus .
In order to free India from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year , the pulse polio program was started by the World Health Organisation which was established in April 7 1948 .
The pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in Delhi in 1994-95 .
Being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in Delhi this program was executed in the whole country in 1995-96 .
Till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country .
The main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places , desert places , forest areas or in any far distanced places .
The pulse polio program will continue for three more years now .
As a result of the comprehensive mission for the eradication of polio in 1998 the number of new cases in the whole country has only been 1934 .
Even after that because of the continuing pulse polio program the number of new cases in 1999 came down to 1126 .
In 2000 this number had reached to 265 and by October 2001 only 100 new cases came within the grasp of polio .
At the same time in 2001 there were only six such states where new cases of polio were witnessed .
Out of these more in Uttar Pradesh  82 cases  and after that 13 cases in Bihar had come forward .
The government had organised the pulse polio vaccination day only twice in 2001 but due to the increase of the number of polio cases to 1630 now the polio vaccination is being done 6 times .
Till May 10th , 2003 whatever cases were registered for polio in the whole country , the maximum 24 out of them were found Uttar Pradesh and 23 were found in Bengal .
Apart from these 8 in Bihar . in Madhya Pradesh . in Rajasthan and 3 in Delhi are included .
By August 21 , 2004 a total of 34 cases had come forward in the country , out of which 20 were of Uttar Pradesh . of Bihar . of Maharashtra and one case each of Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Delhi , Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal .
The government had aimed to eradicate polio from the country by 2007 .
On September 6 , 2007 a case of 11 month old girl has come forward in Jabalpur .
There has been increase in the type of P3 polio and P1 type of polio has also not been destroyed from the roots .
In 2007 1,389 cases were registered in the whole world out of which 864 cases were found in India .
It is known that because of the increase of the cases of polio in India , it has to face criticism from those countries of the world who have eradicated the disease of polio within them .
According to the Ministry of the Centre for Family Welfare the virus of polio has now become limited to some selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar .
Because the virus of polio is found only in the body of human beings its complete eradication is possible .
For this in order to ascertain the abundance of substances  antibody  to fight against polio in human body dose of two drops of sobin vaccine is given through mouth and the dose of Salk vaccine is given through injection under polio immunity vaccine .
India is a country of huge population .
70 percent population of the country stays in rural areas where the health services present are of extremely low standard .
This is the reason that the infant mortality rate is very high in India .
Although the reasons for infant mortality are various and different .
Pulse Polio Mission is a national health safety child mission under the Family Welfare department of Indian Government in which in order to keep children of less than 5 years polio free medicine is made to drink free of cost .
The main purpose of pulse polio mission is to make the children free from physical handicap .
The main base of this mission is to make the pulse polio mission reach to every house and giving the medicine  vaccine  to each child up to 5 years .
For which the Indian government makes the mass aware through the medium of advertisement .
Pulse Polio Mission is actually a team work in which there is equal contribution of each member .
According to the survey of the World Health Organisation more than 15 crore people fall ill due to malaria every year and more than 50 lac patients die .
Malaria epidemic is a contagious disease .
Malaria spreads from mosquito named female anopheles .
Mosquitoes are omnipresent and diseases like dengue , chickengunia and filaria  eliphantiasis  also occur from these .
In malaria disease fever comes following chills and also following sweating .
10 -14 days after the biting of the mosquito the symptoms become visible and the person falls sick .
Because of being an infectious disease it can also occur from one person to the other person .
Apart from chill there is also vomiting in malaria .
There is intense headache in malaria .
The patient may even die if the treatment is not done immediately , because by this the fever rises up to 106 degree Fahrenheit .
After the infection there is lack of blood in the body of the person and the liver and spleen grow large .
Abortion may also occur in pregnant women due to malaria .
Female anopheles mosquito lays its eggs in stagnant water like ponds , lakes , wells , rivers , drains etc. .
These eggs are very small and they keep floating on the surface of the water .
Generally , the eggs and the larva which come out of the eggs thereafter get a place to hide behind the grass or the plants by the side of water .
Larva comes out of the egg in 24-28 hours of the laying of eggs .
Larva gets converted to pupa in 5-6 days , which start taking dips in water .
In 2 or 3 days it flies away becoming an adult mosquito from pupa .
Adult mosquito rests at 45 degree angle from the surface .
This way while becoming mosquitoes from egg their enemy is gambusia fish which eats their eggs in the state of larva , pupa .
Tank kept open on the terrace near the house , useless thrown tyres , cooler , kitchen garden , fountains for decoration , pots and vases , broken vessels , uncovered vessels , disposable glasses , stagnant water near hand pump or tap , wells which are not brought into use , cistern of animals , the stagnant water in the paddy fields , the accumulated watering the monsoon season in the tantrum of the trees , the lakes surrounded with grass , marshy land and the stagnant water of the drains are the shelter place of the mosquitoes .
Malaria is an omnipresent problem .
There is no permanent solution to malaria and neither have the doctors of the world discovered its any inoculation .
Still for safety against mosquitoes you may get mosquito proof nets fixed on the windows and doors of your house .
Certainly put mosquito net while sleeping at night .
Put the repellent cream on the uncovered parts of the body .
In the evening burn the smoke of the leaves of need or the incense stick which drives the mosquito away .
Wear such clothes on body by which the whole body remains covered .
Least number of mosquitoes will bite by this .
In order to stop the breeding of mosquitoes do not let the water accumulate near the house , change the water of the cooler every week .
Do not let water accumulate in the broken vessels kept on the terrace .
Certainly put Gambusia fish in ponds , wells and lakes .
At the onset of malaria fever get the patient 's blood tested .
High blood pressure is dangerous for health .
Blood pressure is not such an illness that can not be controlled .
By adopting a course of abstinence and medicines it is possible to prevent the serious consequences of blood pressure .
Blood pumped from left chamber of the heart circulates in the arteries spread throughout the body and it is the very pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries by blood circulation which is called blood pressure .
The pressure generating in the systolic  shrinking  stage of heart is called systolic blood pressure and the pressure generating in the diastolic  expanding  stage of the heart , diastolic blood pressure .
The systolic blood pressure in a normal person is less than 140 m . . and the diastolic blood pressure is less than 90 m . . of mercury .
Blood pressure of a normal man should be less than 140  90 .
Because of swelling in prostrate gland and its increase in size two kinds of problems happen in urination .
One , difficulty to urinate due to pressure in the line of flow of urine and second , due to contraction in urinary passage and accumulation of urine an infection happens in it .
After that there is swelling in the wall of the urinary bladder .
Due to these complications a variety of difficulties start happening to the patient .
Like repeated urge to defecate urine , urge to urinate at night , effort while urinating at start and not only this urinating drop by drop and having pain while urinating .
The complaint of pain occurs when there is infection in urine .
Because of this complaint of stoppage of urine also occurs and relief is felt only when rubber tube is applied to take out urine .
In this type of patient there is difficulty to completely empty the bag of urine and after urinating also some amount of urine remains in the bag .
Treatment of B . . . disease .
If much enlargement has not happened in the size of the prostrate then to do the treatment neither medicine is needed nor surgery .
In B . . . advice of drinking less water while sleeping at night is given .
If there is a habit of drinking alcohol then advice of leaving it is given .
Not only this , patient is also given advice to leave tea , coffee , etc. .
If after this also the patient does not get relief then medicine is given to reduce action of muscles of prostrate gland .
T . . . : New method of surgery .
Nowadays treatment of prostrate is being done by many new methods whose names are . . . .  . . . . . And T . . . .
T . . .  . . . . . and T . . . . there is no similarity in results in treatment through all three , that is why all are not popular together in these .
Nowadays T . . . are not in use .
On the other hand treatment of prostrate through the use of laser beams is being considered the first choice of therapists .
In the treatment of prostrate T . . . is quite popular and most urologists are using this method .
This is the reason that T . . . . is called gold standard procedure .
After 72 hours discharge is given to the patient and only after a rest of 2-3 days patient can do his daily work .
In T . . . method a telescope is made to enter through the urinary passage , and prostrate is seen through the help of a light and lens attached to it .
In T . . . . method telescope stays attached to a video system .
There are many advantages of surgery by T . . . . Method .
In surgery by T . . . . method patient is given discharge from the hospital after 24 to 72 hours .
In surgery by T . . . . method , necessity of making a cut in the stomach of patient is not needed .
In surgery by T . . . method because of less time of the patient 's staying admitted chances of infection become quite reduced .
During surgery by T . . . method there is less bleeding .
In surgery by T . . . method patient recovers after only 2 to 3 days .
On treatment of prostrate by T . . . . method , after a few days there is a complaint of clot of blood coming in urine of patient many times .
The complaint of appearance of clot of blood is a common problem which can be seen in a surgery of this kind .
This happens due to rupture of small blood vessels during surgery .
Secretion increases on blood pressure increasing extremely , getting a fit of cough or in a state of excessive infection .
Many times this problem is seen years after surgery also .
If there is a mistake in detection of disease because of some reason then after later on it is prostrate cancer and its surgery is done .
In such a situation the part of place of surgery becomes stiff like stone .
The turning of the part of place of surgery becoming stiff like stone occurs because of cancer having spread reaching into the third stage .
When the growth of cancer reaches the fourth stage then it also takes the bones in its embrace .
The other problem of this surgery is that of the flow of urine becoming reduced .
To get rid of this problem therapist puts a rubber tube in the urinary passage of the patient that helps urinate .
After a few days tension in it goes away on its own because of the tube .
Increasing havoc of Asthma in childhood .
Asthma is a form of allergy .
In this the ultrasensitive breathing tubes contract on coming in contact with allergy-causing elements .
The chest muscles have to work more hard on breathing in and breathing out during respiration through contracted breathing tubes .
Due to this sound of whistle starts coming from chest .
Due to swelling in the mucous membrane of breathing tubes and increase in secretion of its glands problems like cough and phlegm also happen .
Due to contraction of breathing tubes in children during asthma , they have more distress as compared to elders .
The breathing tubes of children are thin and capacity of lungs is less .
In some children the symptoms of allergy start reducing on increase in age and they become healthy by the age of 4-5 years .
In some older children other than viral asthma attack can occur due to sensitivity towards smoke , tobacco smoke , cold , sun , etc . also .
In other children asthma attack can happen due to laughing and crying .
Gradually these children can become sensitive to dust , animal skin , fiber strands , hair , body waste etc . and on coming in contact with these asthma attack can occur .
At nearly around 20 years of age allergy is produced by pollen grain to these sensitive individuals .
In some children attack occurs due to some specific food matter .
The main causes of asthma .
To an extent allergy and asthma are also hereditary .
If parents are allergic then the chances of children being allergic are more .
Besides this on being hereditarily sensitive attack of asthma can occur on coming in contact with increasing polluted elements present in the environment , being allergic to smoke or other chemicals of motor vehicles and factories .
Dirt , dust , smell of house , smoke of fuel can produce asthma attack in children .
The chances of city children versus village children to be asthmatic are more .
Environment of cities is more polluted .
The children whose guardians or other members of home smoke inside the house chances of those children to be asthmatic are more .
Because of being afflicted with disease repeatedly children with asthma generally get physically weak .
The physical and mental development of these children could also be hindered .
The solutions of disease of Asthma .
Exceptional development has taken place in the treatment of Asthma .
With use of appropriate caution and medicines control over disease can be obtained .
By being careful and care , also the physical and mental development of the child take place in a normal way .
Give regular medicine to child with asthma according to the therapist 's advice .
Get their examination done at regular intervals .
To reduce the chances of allergy , asthma in future , children should be fed on mother 's milk .
Also , do not give solid food to babies for 4 months .
After this gradually start giving fruit , vegetables first and then grains .
In children brought up drinking mother 's milk chances of allergy are less as compared to cow milk drinking children .
Make the small children lie down on soft , cotton bed sheets and cover them .
If the child is asthmatic then do not make him sleep on a dusty bed .
Entire preparation of letting smoke out of the kitchen should be done .
In children asthma can occur due to allergy by animal hair , skin , hair , excrement , etc also .
If the child is asthmatic then do not let pet animals inside the house .
Give minimum amount of ice cream , cold drinks , chocolates , chaat , fast food etc to children victim to asthma .
Now for treatment of Asthma , spray taken from the mouth is used .
Immediate relief is felt with use of spray taken from the mouth .
Because of less amount of medicine chances of adverse effect are also less .
In case of children getting asthma the disease can be controlled by maintaining caution and by giving appropriate treatment .
While leading a normal life children can participate in all kinds of work and games .
Hepatitis . can be more dangerous than AIDS .
Hepatitis-B is a common disease happening worldwide whose virus infects the liver in a serious manner .
Virus of Hepatitis-B produce swelling in the liver because of which it can not function properly .
This disease is even more infectious than AIDS because it goes very easily into body of another person via blood .
Just one virus of Hepatitis B is enough to spread this disease .
Other than blood it also spreads by other fluids and liquid substances coming out of body .
Like defecation , mother 's milk , tears , drool and open wounds .
By eating medicine on time and by following the advice of doctor 95 % people get better in 6 months .
The causes behind spreading of Hepatitis-B are the following .
If blood of infected person is transfused in the body of a healthy person or the shot which was given to an infected person is given to a normal person then this virus goes from the infected person to the healthy person .
The most important causes of Hepatitis B happen to be at the time of child birth from the womb of infected mothers .
During this , the blood which touches the body of the child , the virus situated in that infected blood goes inside the child as soon as coming in contact with the blood of the child .
Along with India in all the countries of Asia this type of infection spreads a lot and new born baby gets infected from infancy itself .
In the field of athletics when an infected individual gets wounded and if his blood somehow comes in contact with the blood of a healthy person then it spreads very easily .
It also spreads exceedingly among those who consume drugs via needle .
If an applied syringe taken from an infected person is used by another person then virus goes in the healthy person .
When someone in man and woman is infected with Hepatitis B and they have unprotected sexual intercourse then by this also the virus goes in the healthy person .
The way virus of AIDS spreads that way virus of Hepatitis B also spreads .
Even 1 part of blood of a person infected with Hepatitis B is capable of spreading Hepatitis B .
Hepatitis B is more dangerous than AIDS can be reckoned by this fact that the number of people that die because of Hepatitis B in 1 day is same as the number of people that die with the infection of AIDS in a year .
In India healthy person is also infected with Hepatitis B .
In many individuals despite being Hepatitis B positive they do not have the knowledge that they have Hepatitis B because this virus is unable to affect that individual too much .
If Hepatitis B infects young people then 95 % get free of the disease in 6 months only . Only the remaining 5 % stay infected with the disease .
The main symptoms of Hepatitis B .
In the first state of infection the person has symptoms like that of viral fever .
Not feeling hungry , feeling nauseous , getting fever , these symptoms stay for 5 . days and after 7 days eyes start becoming yellow and urine becomes yellow .
Which is called jaundice in common tongue .
Jaundice keeps increasing till 2 to 4 weeks .
In 95 % people it gets treated in 2 to 4 weeks .
On getting Hepatitis B it should be shown to a gastroenterologist immediately .
For treatment of Hepatitis B or jaundice several types of superstitions are in effect in society .
Therefore for its treatment one should save oneself from falling into any kind of superstition .
Vaccination : To save liver from virus of Hepatitis B a very effective vaccine is available .
Those who have been given this vaccine in them in 99 % 's bodies effective protective disease antibodies are produced .
Vaccine of Hepatitis B is helpful in stopping infection of jaundice .
This vaccine is to be given to people thrice .
In baby being born the first vaccine immediately after taking birth , second after 1 month and third after 6 months .
In adults also it is given thrice .
Treatment for prevention of Hepatitis B .
In blood of person infected with Hepatitis B this virus stays alive for 7 days .
Hence other person should not use the towel , brush , comb of infected person .
For acupuncture everyone should use new needles .
Otherwise via these needles also virus of infected person will go into a healthy person .
Razor of an infected person should not be brought in use by another person .
Infection can also spread by defecation of infected person .
Therefore a healthy person should make use of toilet after complete cleaning of it or if possible another one .
While having sexual intercourse infected person should surely make use of condom .
If a person is Hepatitis B positive and if all other members of his family have not been given vaccine then vaccine should be given .
Dissolve 100-250 grams sugar in water and drink daily during meals .
Eat pulses  2 . bowls  , khichdi , porridge , rice , potatoes , sago porridge , sweet potatoes , rice puffs .
Eat more green leafy vegetables .
Take milk and fresh curd , not sour curd .
Eat less egg , fish .
Do not consume liqueur , bidi , cigarette , zarda at all .
Precautions from Hepatitis B .
Person infected with Hepatitis B should absolutely keep himself from fatigue .
Keep oneself from too much athletics or running around .
Do not pick up heavy things or do not do very hard labor .
Do not be careless in treatment of spine tumor .
In human body other body parts are attached to the spine in such a way that it can move body around according to its own convenience .
All daily jobs done by humans are effected by ` spinal cord ' situated in body .
On this Earth most developed is the very human mind which thinks for sure but it is given consequence by ` spinal cord ' only .
In body role of spinal cord safe in the backbone is like an electric wire , like on pressing a switch bulb turns on .
but electricity reaches the bulb through the wire only .
Just like this , in getting every job finished , role of spinal cord is foremost .
Spine happens to be the base of the whole body and rest of the bones are joined to each other like the ends of a staff .
Back bone not being straight like a staff is made of 33 vertebrae and between every two vertebrae there is a disc .
At the posterior side of back bone there are many tiny joints .
It is these discs and joints that impart the ability to the back bone , that we can bend on all four sides .
As bones of other parts of body get worn with age , just like that back bone also gets worn .
In many people due to the amount of water being less disc tears so there is waist pain .
This pain can go from the neck towards the hand or the waist towards the foot .
Now treatment of tumor in spine has been considered very hard but today due to a lot of techniques it has become easy .
In spine tumor most common are those tumors in which cancer is in some other part of the body and tumor has occurred in the bone .
In this prostrate cancer is also included .
It is called metastasis .
In our country most of the spine tumor patients are of this category .
In spine tumor other than backache there is danger of paralysis in legs due to pressure on nerves .
Other than tumor of spine there can be tumor in spinal cord .
The unique thing about this tumor is that it can occur at any age .
In treatment of this , other than removing the bone , as soon as treatment from chemotherapy and radiotherapy is possible it is good .
Because at a later stage patient does not get any benefit from it .
Treatment of spinal cord is only surgery .
The direct relation of back ache is with back bone .
According to ` Spine Society of India ' 10 to 15 crore people above 30 years of age are patients of backache .
To escape from backache however modern technique of operation is available in country but there is no better treatment than precaution .
In our spine between every two vertebra there is a thin , flexible membrane or cushion which is called an inter-vertebra disc .
By this flexibility comes in spine and it works like a spring .
Many times due to imbalance in muscles else by suddenly picking up weight or by suddenly bending the body , the part in the inner side of the intervertebral disc which is very soft , by shifting , comes towards the hole between two vertebrae .
By this pressure is exerted on the nerves there and pain is felt anywhere from waist to leg .
Tingling and weakness is felt in legs .
Nowadays for treatment of slip disc , surgery like spinal endoscopy has become possible .
Firstly it is important to know what is the cause behind slip disc .
If by working too much backache or waist pain is occurring then it will get better by resting .
Do not keep body in tension .
Do not pick up too much weight , prevent constipation .
Develop habit of exercise from start , climbing stairs and strolling at a brisk pace is a good exercise .
Do not just work , also take rest .
Keep your sitting posture right , take a balanced diet .
In meals include vegetables with Calcium .
Take green vegetables and vitamin D .
Diseases of thoracic spine and VAT surgery .
Nowadays due to increasing use of computer eruption of pain in neck is increasing fast .
In big cities of India and in metropolitan cities , in the face of increasing use of computer there is a rapid increase in number of people afflicted with waist pain .
From children to aged everyone can be affected by waist pain .
Increasing age , heavy physical work , people working in the same condition for a long time  like secretary , receptionist , workers of call center  , people who pick up heavy loads get affected more .
If it is the case of It is treatment then several kinds of treatments are also present .
Bed rest , injection , surgical treatment , spinal fusion , disc transplant , vertebroplasty , pinhole surgery and minimum invasive surgery , etc. .
Now the beginning of a new surgery has been done and it is , VAT surgery  Video Assisted Thoracoscopy  .
Today diseases related to backbone have increased a lot .
Till now surgery of thoracoscopic spine  which happens to be behind the chest  is very difficult and excruciating .
For this the surgery was possible only by cutting the ribs and by removing the heart and lungs to one side , the side effects of which used to be very serious .
But now by VAT surgery it has become possible to treat these diseases very easily by cutting and ripping .
What are the common diseases of thoracic spine ?
In thoracic spine like neck and waist all diseases are possible , like slip disc , tumor , infection like T . . fracture , hunchback , etc .
In diseases of thoracic spine behind the chest , there is pain in waist and tension in chest .
This pain can sometimes go down to the legs .
With this it can produce numbness in legs , difficulty in walking and in daily activities .
The cause behind all these difficulties is pressure on nerves .
Now this pressure can be easily reduced via VAT surgery .
By this the distortion of waist in patients of hunchback can be removed easily .
The benefits of VAT surgery .
In VAT surgery all those surgeries are possible through a thin telescope by reaching the backbone while watching on a TV screen , which were possible before on cutting open the chest .
The whole VAT surgery gets over in only 1-2 hours .
The main advantage of VAT is that patient can start walking around from next day , there is no risk of bleeding or infection and patient gets a discharge from the hospital in 3 days .
With this , for patients of hunchback , deformation of waist can be easily reduced .
Cancer of gall bladder can be fatal .
In cancer of gall bladder there is no pain from the start .
Gall bladder closes because of cancer .
Because of which jaundice can happen to the patient in the last stage of his life .
Gall bladder can be removed by inserting a s stunt in the infected part present in the gall bladder of patient of cancer .
So that the patient does not face much trouble in last stage .
It would be better that the patient is admitted to such a hospital where there are better stomach disease experts so that the anguish of patient is reduced at the end of his life .
Cancer of gall bladder , on increasing , spreads even to the lymph node of stomach then this is also not possible that it be cut and removed from body via surgery .
Cancer spreading to the lymph node means that the chances of the patient recovering fully becomes 0 % .
Why do lymph nodes enlarge in stomach ?
Ordinarily lymph nodes are found in the stomach of all individuals but when they increase inside the stomach then there are many reasons behind their enlargement .
These lymph nodes of stomach enlarge due to T . . disease also .
Their own cancer in lymph nodes which is called Lymphoma , because of that also they can enlarge .
Other than lymph node one more cancer is also there which is called Hodgkin 's disease , or in some other part of body if cancer is occurring then lymph nodes enlarge in the stomach .
Cancer of stomach and cancer of gall bladder mostly spread in the lymph nodes of stomach only .
If in the gall bladder there is some ordinary common defect then it is removed out of the body .
Patient can lead a normal life but if cancer is in its first stage .
If cancer on increasing reaches the lymph nodes then it is a late stage of cancer , and in this attempts can also be made to save the patient .
Cancer is surely a horrible disease , but if detected in time then this disease can be cured too .
Therefore after 30 years , 35 years and 40 years of age every person should certainly get a medical examination of all his body parts done once .
After that every 4 . years one should get consistently examined .
In men mostly there is cancer of lungs .
Hence x-ray of chest should be done every year after 35 - 40 years of age .
In men secondly , cancer of mouth is main .
For this first of all while standing in front of the mirror yourself , look inside your mouth whether there is a white spot , mixed red and white spot or any blister which is not healing by medicines .
Daily , also , surely clean your mouth .
Keep away from consumption of paan-gutkha and other intoxicating things .
If jaundice has happened to some patient then the chances of liver cancer happening to him increase .
In men of 60 years of age cancer of prostrate is also found .
Cancer of prostrate is that which increases gradually .
So that cancer does not occur in any part of body , regular medical examination of body is definitely the foremost , also with it abstain from ghee , oil , fats and much sugar in meals .
Use fibrous food material , fresh green leafy vegetables and fruits .
Take vitamin A . . . .
Eat Indian gooseberry , lemon and every seasonal fruit .
Do not do intake of much cold or hot .
Do not consume betel nut , tobacco , gutkha , khaini , etc. .
Consume pure fresh vegetarian food and water .
Drink a lot of water and do not use much chillies and spices .

Protection of heart .
No matter what , heart should be kept safely because heart is the most important part of body .
As long as heart beats go on our breaths go on .
Heart of human is of four chambers meaning ` left-right auricles ' and ` left-right ventricles ' .
Between auricles and ventricles special ` valves ' have been made which in reality do the work of gatekeeper .
The valve of the left side is called ` mitral ' and valve of right side is called ` tricuspid ' .
From these blood can go from auricle to ventricle only and can not come back up because by then they are closed .
This way at the meeting point of ventricles and main blood-carriers also these valves of the shape of half moon give permission to blood to circulate in the whole body through the medium of the main blood-carriers .
Blood is not able to return back into the heart because by that time these valves shut .
After all what is the necessity of blood circulation every moment ?
Medical literature says that by complete blood circulation 1200 cc Oxygen is received by every cell that is successful in giving only 5 minutes of life to them , hence it is necessary for blood circulation to get activated again .
The blood carriers that take pure blood to all cells are called arteries .
Veins ' is name of those blood-carriers that collect blood from all over the body and do the job of returning it back to the heart .
Hence there is no exaggeration of this condition that our heart is greater and more efficient than any human made instrument .
Obesity ' is the announcement for commencement of heart disease .
When the amount of cholesterol is more In blood , blood clot gets stuck in the heart artery and stops blood circulation .
As a consequence of fatty accumulation on all four sides of blood carriers heart rate increases and the results are fatal .

Getting a disease by ` uncontrolled diabetes ' and high blood pressure is 100 % possible .
Heart disease is also hereditary meaning disease that is received in inheritance .

As a result such desperation occurs that difficulty in breathing is produced and body gets swathed in sweat .
If it is a very acute attack person may faint too .
Acute pain of back can also be a symptom of heart attack which is between both shoulders and below neck .
Symptoms of this type are produced a few minutes , few hours , few days or few weeks before .
Disease producing heart disease in children is ` rheumatic heart disease ' .
Fever occurring on getting a sore throat damages heart and its valves forever .
Pain in joints , increase in weight , slight fever , persistently phlegmatic throat , lessening appetite , bleeding from nose , etc . are its main source of identification .
Local anemia often traps rich , intellectual and people above 40 years of age .
In main blood carriers due to accumulation of fatty substances , they become narrow or stiff .
Due to which the heart has to put in more pressure for blood circulation because the pathway of blood circulation becomes narrow .

What is stress urinary incontinence ?
With increasing age the problem of urine coming out unknowingly can not be overlooked just like that .
While finishing daily chores of life , while coughing or sneezing , laughing , while picking up stuff by bending sudden leakage of urine is called S . . . that is , stress urinary incontinence .
The specialists of International Urology Association have to say that an individual 's muscles and connective tissue which are a support of Urethra , do not remain so capable to be able to support the Urethra .
Then automatically the problem of leakage of urine arises .
Other than this when sphincter , that works like a valve , during pressure is not able to stay shut then also urine leaks out in some amount .
In Indian women there are around 2 . crore cases of S . . . that do not come forward due to lack of awareness and hesitation related to the disease .
By International Urology Association such an estimation has been made that 1 out of 3 women at some point in their life has to face S . . .

However this disease has been seen most in women of 35 to 60 years of age .
But its not even like it can be considered a problem of increasing age because , due to weakening of pelvis muscles and tissues connected to them on account of pregnancy , labor , continuously picking up heavy things , menopause or obesity , the disease occurs .
The doctors from International Urology are of the opinion that there are many other reasons behind S . . .
Main in which are - pregnancy .
During pregnancy some hormones of body weaken the muscles of pelvis .
Along with this the weight and pressure of womb also falls on those muscles .
The problem of S . . . happens to more than half of women during pregnancy .
During labor : During the birth of child by the tension from nearby muscles they get torn and worn by which the danger of S . . . increases .
Due to obesity : On account of much pressure on stomach near the bladder there is tension and by this danger of S . . . increases .
According to body ratio people with much weight and patients of terminal obesity have more danger of S . . .
After menopause estrogen level decreases and due to this when there is pressure on Urethra chances of S . . . increase .
After menopause weight of women also starts increasing and this becomes the accessorial reason behind occurrence of the disease .
Hysterectomy : Due to surgery of uterus also muscles of pelvis can get injured .
Side effect of medicines . . . . can happen by adverse effect medicines to control blood pressure or anti-depressants and sleeping pills also .
In the options for treatment of S . . . medication and surgery both are included .
In which anti depressant medicines duloxetine or imipramine are to be taken and paseries  use of removable medical apparatus which can be fitted in the vagina  has to be used .
Bladder neck suspension like M . . .  Marshall Marchetti Krantz  and brush suspension have to be made use of , bulking agents like hydrogen injection  periurethral injection  have to be applied , etc .
Other than this use of T . . .  tension free vaginal tape  is also included .
T . . . is a new find by which support can be given to Urethra .
After bringing it in use once woman suffering from S . . . gets a long relief .
In this woman does not have to go through the bother of staying in the hospital for too long .
The best thing is that there is no big surgery for T . . .
Because of this there is also no threat of any scars remaining on stomach .
By a specialist surgeon applied bandage in T . . . tape is affixed .
Excellent material is used in making T . . . tape .
The company that makes T . . . determines its high quality .
The T . . . applied in the treatment of S . . . is successfully brought into use by about 10 lakh women in the whole country .
It takes even less time than 30 minutes in finishing the safe procedure of T . . .

Main symptoms of jaundice .
In jaundice substance named bilirubin becomes more than normal .
As a consequence of which in the gaps of skin , nails , urine and mouth yellowness is seen .
Bilirubin named colored substance is made in our body absolutely everyday .
The root source of generation of bilirubin are red molecules of blood .
The life of red molecules of blood has been considered as about 120 days .
They get destroyed after 120 days .
On getting destroyed substance named bilirubin is born out of them .
Bilirubin keeps going round in our body through the course of blood .
Through the course of blood bilirubin reaches our liver .
In the liver a bit of bilirubin gets destroyed and some part through the bile juice after reaching small intestine gets mixed with faeces and gives faeces its own color .
This is the very reason that the colors of faeces are various .
If there comes an obstruction in the bile duct that makes bilirubin reach the intestine from the liver then this substance does not reach the intestine .
As a result color of faeces becomes white .
Faeces becoming white is considered the main symptom of jaundice .

Dr . Minocha of Batra Hospital has to say that ' actually our skin has three layers - epidermis , dermis and subcutaneous . .
The outermost layer which is visible to us , it is called epidermis .
The middle layer is called dermis and the innermost layer is called epidermis .
Dermis has flexibility and the protein and moisture in it helps in preventing wrinkles .
With advancement in age the flexibility and moisture in dermis starts reducing by which the layer becomes thin and is not able to send moisture to the outer layer .
The result of which are wrinkles .
According to beauty expert Arti Sharma , after the age of 30 years women should be cautions towards wrinkles .
If from beginning some things are kept in mind then for many years wrinkles can be averted .
In order to stay protected against wrinkles do not stay in direct light of sun for very long .
Especially the ultra violet rays of the sun from 10 o ' clock in the morning till evening become the biggest cause of wrinkles .
While going out in sun , swimming or in the field of sports , make use of sun - protection cream .
Abstain from smoking .
Smoking absorbs the precious moisture of skin because of which wrinkles form before time .
Daily massage your skin with hydrating cream or moisturiser especially when the air is dry .
By applying excessive cream on face the pores get closed because of which the sweat does not come out profusely and becomes the reason for prickly heat and wrinkles .
If yoga is done then one can stay safe from wrinkles for quite long time .
If with other precautions you practice yoga then till 55 years of age the wrinkles will not appear .
Keep in mind that for oily , dry , fine , sensitive skins etc the lotions are also of different types .
Use lotion only after taking advice from the specialist .

Due to osteoporosis the bones become weak and start breaking gradually by becoming brittle .
Osteoporosis is a disease which occurs because of deficiency of calcium and Vitamin D .
Maximum women come to know about this when there is any fracture in their bones and the bones do not join easily .
Generally the women of advanced age get affected more by osteoporosis , the level of estrogen decreases because of menopause .
Apart from this , not doing physical labor after menopause and the deficiency of Vitamin d and calcium in diet are the chief causes of osteoporosis .
If you suspect osteoporosis then get X - ray done immediately .
For the test of X-ray the use of technique named dexa is used .

Because of hyper activity of thyroid gland the quantity of thyroid hormone starts increasing .

Generally the women are affected with hyper thyroid .
The detection of thyroid is very easy .
India was the first country in which the national program for blindness prevention was started in 1970 after detecting the comprehensiveness of the deficiency of Vitamin A .
Short term and long term solutions have been included in this national program .
The plan for long term solutions have been made for making Vitamin A rich food materials abundant and to encourage their food .
On the other hand in order to prevent blindness and to avoid the other ill effects of deficiency of Vitamin A the heavy dose of Vitamin A to children from 6 months to 5 years is a short term solution .
National nutrition Organisation , Hyderabad reviewed this national program in 1978 .
In order to achieve the desired result from the program it has been found that it is important to make the related health workers and those running the program more aware together with the immense cooperation of people of the community .
The department of health and family welfare formed a task force in 1989 to prepare the principles to rectify the execution of the Vitamin A program and to clarify the ways of the work .
Under this effort a booklet has been prepared for the health workers and those who are running the program .
In the program of national prevention of disease against the blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A it is important to make the working staff of program more aware together with immense cooperation of the people of the community .
The problem of the deficiency of Vitamin A .
In the developing countries the deficiency of Vitamin A has been identified as a chief problem occurring due to the deficiency of nutrition and control over it can be achieved .
The role of Vitamin A in the prevention of blindness due to lack of nutrition is very well known .
According to a vague estimation the eye sight of around 30 - 40 thousand children may be lost due to deficiency of Vitamin A .
By getting Vitamin A in huge quantity blindness occurring due to lack of nutrition can be prevented .
Vitamin A has a very huge hand in correcting the health of children and reducing their mortality rate .
Till now there is no clear knowledge as to how Vitamin A does such vital works .
It has been noticed in Indonesia that the children in whom there is deficiency of Vitamin A , in them the danger of onset of dysentery and the grave type of infection related to respiration increases by 2 to 3 times .
Death of around 50 percent children in India is due to dysentery and the diseases related to respiratory diseases .
Because of measles the quantity of accumulated Vitamin A in the body decreases .
Because of the heavy fall in quantity of Vitamin A the danger of chances of other diseases increase .
These diseases are pneumonia , onset of dysentery and dry eye discharge  xerophthalmia  .
Every year thousands of children die due to measles and other complications occurring because of it .
Apart from this the cornea of the eye is damaged due to this and the child may also become blind .
The deficiency of Vitamin A - why and how ?
The deficiency of Vitamin A gives rise to xerophthalmia that is , the disease of dry eye discharge  the drying up of eye  .
In xerophthalmia the outermost layer of the pupil , that is , conjunctiva and after that the layer below the conjunctiva , cornea , dries up .
Due to the damage of cornea after this the eye sight is lost .
When the accumulated Vitamin A in body finishes and the quantity of Vitamin A received by body through daily food is less than required then xerophthalmia occurs .
Xerophthalmia occurs due to these reasons .
Xerophthalmia occurs due to the reduced consumption of less food rich in Vitamin A everyday .
Xerophthalmia occurs due to the error in transmission of the absorbed retinol to the right place in the body and the fast depletion of the accumulated Vitamin in the body .
The deficiency of food materials rich in Vitamin , the reduction of the quantity of Vitamin A accumulated in the body are the chief causes of xerophthalmia .
The absorption of Vitamin A in the children victims of dysentery , respiration related infections , measles , diseases of stomach and intestines decreases and its need to the body increases .
As a result of this a cabal of infections starts .
Because of the deficiency of Vitamin a the power of the body to fight with the infections is reduced .
Due to infection the health of the child goes on deteriorating .
Eye related signals and symptoms .
Although the deficiency of Vitamin A affects many organs but its worst effect is seen on the eyes because of which eye sight is constantly lost .
The surface of the cornea becomes dry and rough which later on ruptures partially or completely .
Wound develops because of this in the cornea .
The damage to eyes is such due to the wound in the cornea that it is permanent , that is , it can never become alright .
The eye sight goes by this .
Eye related symptoms are the most trustworthy measure to identify the deficiency of Vitamin A .
In the serious condition of disease the grave symptoms may become visible early .
It is not essential that mild symptoms before order and grave symptoms later on are visible .
The detection of the signs and symptoms of xerophthalmia .
Night blindness : the first symptom of xerophthalmia .
In night blindness the child can not see after darkness or things kept near him in the room .
Bitata stains - although there could be difference in the shape , place and design of the bitata stains but they are similar in appearance .
Bitata stains are formed due to the accumulation of frothy substance on conjunctiva .
If disease of keratomalacia is not treated then cornea at the place of wound may get permanently damaged .
Due to keratomalacia a hole may occur in the cornea .
In the condition of hole in cornea the damage would never be corrected .
The sooner the treatment of keratomalacia is done the smaller would be the wound and the damage of cornea .
If the treatment is done fast then the damage of the cornea and the blindness occurring due to it can be completely prevented .
India was the first country which had implemented a national level program to prevent blindness occurring in children of less than 5 years due to the deficiency of Vitamin A .
In order to prevent blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A . national disease prevention program was started in 1970 .
Initially the prevention program was started in those seven states where the problem was more serious .
By 1975 the disease prevention program was implemented in the entire country in the form of a national program .
At present the national disease prevention program is being run amidst 3 crore children less than 5 years of age .
The help of two principles is being taken in implementation of the national disease prevention program .
In the short term principle heavy dose of Vitamin A is given time to time to children less than 5 years of age .
The danger of blindness due to the deficiency of Vitamin A is the maximum in the children less than five years of age .
At first the age of pre school children  1 to 5 years  was included in this program .
Now by giving an extension to this program children of 6 - 11 months are also being included .
Together with this there is the proposal to give priority to children from 6 months to 3 years .
Giving extra dose of Vitamin A in addition from time to time is effective and safe .
On giving the dose of Vitamin A in limited quantity its ill effects are negligible .
At times the effects of headache and vomiting are seen but they are seldom and common .
The prevention of blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A .
The decided dose of Vitamin A is as follows .
Children of 6-11 months : giving the dose 1,00,000 I . .
The time of the inoculation of measles is a good time to give the dose of Vitamin A .
Children of 1-5 years : The dose of 2,00,000 IU every 6 months .
The treatment of children affected with the deficiency of Vitamin A .
On the identification of deficiency of Vitamin A all children affected with this must be immediately given the dose of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A .
One to four weeks after this second dose of 2,00,000 I . . of Vitamin A should be given .
In order to avoid the occurrence of the deficiency of Vitamin A again the regular intake of Vitamin A rich food items like green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables of yellow pulp should be encouraged .
Children who are suffering from dysentery , intense respiratory infection , an eye must be kept carefully on them .
Such children must be administered the normal dose of Vitamin A .
For the national program the solution of Vitamin A comes in the form of a fragrant syrup in bottle of 100 millilitre .
The quantity of Vitamin A in syrup is 1,00,000 I . . per millilitre .
With each bottle there is also a spoon of 2 ml measurement with it .
By consuming the syrup by filling up to the mark on spoon the determined quantity of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A is obtained .
In order to keep Vitamin A there is no need of any special type of arrangement like the cold series .
Then also Vitamin A should be kept in dark and cold room protected from sunlight .
After opening the bottle all its solution must be used within 6 . weeks .
On not opening the bottle , the solution of Vitamin A in the bottle stays safe when kept in dark and cold place for around one year .
The cost of 100ml of the bottle of the syrup is around rupees 25 . 00 or the cost of one dose of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A is around 50 paise .
The solution of Vitamin A is given free to the community through the medium of primary health center .
Apart from this , capsule of the determined dose of Vitamin A  1,00,000 IU  comes for the infant kids as well .
By cutting one end of the capsule with scissors or clean blade all the content filled in it must be squeezed in the mouth of the infant baby .
Vitamin A syrup is obtained from the ministry of health and family welfare .
On the basis of the probable number of the beneficiaries  the children from 6 months to 5 years of age  the medical officer of the primary health center should put a demand for the required quantity of Vitamin A .
The maternal and child health department of health and family welfare department is that central department which has the complete responsibility of the implementation of program .
The program is implemented by the primary health center and sub center in the rural areas under the guidance of medical officers .
The medical officer of the primary health center is in charge of getting Vitamin A , administering dose of Vitamin A to children and guiding the program .
The responsibility of administering dose to children in primary health centres is on assistant health nurses  ANM  and on other paramedical workers .
Comprehensive immunity  inoculation  program provides an opportunity of coming in contact with the newborn babies .
The contact happening with the newborn babies of 9 - 12 months for the inoculation of measles is the best time for giving the first dose of Vitamin A  1,00,000 IU  .
Intensive Children Development Service  ICDS  program provides opportunity to give Vitamin A to children of 6 months to 5 years of age .
Not only should Aanganbari workers help in identifying needy children but they should also help in administering Vitamin A dose and health education to areas where ICDS program is running .
By his fifth birthday the child should get nine doses of Vitamin A in total .
In order to keep track of the Vitamin A dose being given to the children of less than two years the mother-child security card should be brought into use .
Under the ICDS program vigilance is kept on all the children of up to 6 years so that the use of their growth vigilance card is behavioural .
Lack of Vitamin A in food and lack of accumulated Vitamin A in the body are chief reasons of xerophthalmia .
In children of pre - school age lack of Vitamin A and carotene  the initial form of Vitamin A  in the daily diet is the chief reason of tension .
The amount of Vitamin A and carotene in the diet of children have been found less than half of the daily proposed quantity of 400 gram retinol or 1600 microgram of beta - carotene .
The absorption of Vitamin A decreases in children suffering from dysentery , breathing infections , stomach related diseases , measles and other diseases .
In the lack and prevention of Vitamin A help may be got in the control and prevention of malnutrition through immunity , proper nutrition , oral rehydration and timely treatment .
The last resort in the prevention of the lack of Vitamin A is the regular consumption of Food items rich with Vitamin A .
The food items rich with Vitamin A Are cheap as well as locally available .
The getting of Vitamin A should be ascertained right from the time of birth .
Along with the feeding of colostrum or milk  the milk that is secreted from the mother ' s breast immediately after the birth of child  the need of Vitamin A would be fulfilled during the first six months of breast feeding of the child .
Between the age of four to six months initiating giving abundantly Vitamin A rich food is very essential .
The food items included in this are green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables consisting of yellow pulp  carrot , Capsicum , gourd , papaya , mango and sweet potato  .
The quantity of Vitamin A received from 100 grams of edible part in maximum green leafy vegetables is more than the daily received dose of Vitamin A prescribed for the diet of Indian children .
After cooking this much of vegetable is reduced to only two tablespoonful .
Along with the other food items a child can eat this much of vegetable easily .
This way he can easily fulfil his daily need of Vitamin A .
The inclusion of other food items rich in Vitamin A apart from green leafy vegetables like dairy products  milk , cheese , curd , butter  liver , eggs , ghee and oil should also be encouraged .
Such habits related to diet put a stop on the lack of Vitamin A .
The consumption of green leafy vegetables and other food items rich with vitamin A everyday during pregnancy and breast feeding is advised .
Because of the state of Vitamin A in the body of the mother the quantity of Vitamin A in the mother ' s milk and by that the health of the child is affected .
Because of the consumption of food materials rich in vitamin A in abundant quantity during pregnancy and breast feeding there is never a lack of Vitamin A in both mother and child .
Nutrition education is an integral part of primary health services and ICDS program and under this emphasis must be given on the encouragement of the use of food items highly rich in Vitamin A .
The ultimate solution to the problem is implicit in providing education of eating food items rich in Vitamin A to people .
The consumption of regular and sufficient quantity of Vitamin A in the children of preschool age and pregnant and breast feeding women should be ascertained .
The implementation of the national program in effective manner .
The program can be implemented effectively only with the help of trained workers and the rise of community awareness of high level .
The training must be given to the entire team providing health services and the workers of ICDS program .
The workers of both the areas will be benefitted by this in playing their responsibility in the implementation of the program in effective manner .
The following matters must be paid attention to while training .
The effect of the deficiency of Vitamin A. .
The recording of the signs and symptoms of the lack of Vitamin A .
The identification of people receiving dose of Vitamin A .
Along with getting Vitamin A the treatment of lack and stopping of Vitamin A by giving heavy dose of Vitamin A .
The reduction and stopping of the lack of Vitamin A by encouraging the consumption of food items rich in Vitamin A available at local level . The effective methods of special message and communication .
The encouragement of community participation .
The technique of recording and the method of reporting .
The lack of Vitamin A is the chief health problem of the mass among the children of preschool age in India .
According to a rough estimate 30 to 40 thousand children become victims of preventable blindness every year .
The danger of infections in children increases because of lack of Vitamin A and the chances of their falling sick and dying also possibly increases .
The benefit received from Vitamin A complex makes the national disease prevention program stop the blindness occurring due to lack of Vitamin A very widely effective .
The officers of health and ICDS program and the controllers of these programs can play the role effective support in saving the eye sight of crores of children and improving their life .
Under the National Disease Prevention Programme implemented against the blindness happening due to the lack of Vitamin A 3 crore children below the age of five years are being benefitted at this time .
Under this program two chief principles are being adopted .
One is short term principle and the second is log term principle .
Under the first principle the arrangement of administering heavy dose to children between the age of 6 months and 5 years has been done .
Under the second plan emphasis is given on getting more vitamin through the medium of vitamin A rich food materials like green leafy vegetables , yellow vegetables and fruits , regular consumption of dairy products and breastfeeding .
Encouragement is given on consumption more quantity of vitamin A rich food materials  which are cheap and which are also available regionally  and on educating the children because this is the last solution to stop the deficiency of Vitamin A .
The mobile phones of hospital staff become home of diseases .
The mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern life style may become the reason for the spreading of disease .
This fact has come forward in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of MGM hospital situated in Washi here .
More than 82 percent workers of hospitals are found to be the careers of microbes and organisms of contagious diseases in a study .
The doubt of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , pimples , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases are in this .
According to the study done by the Indian Medical Research Council the test of 120 mobile phones of the workers were done .
The researcher final year student of MBBS of MGM medical college Dr . Nikhil Tambe has found that such organisms and microbes have been found on 99 phones , which along with making the disease of the patient serious may also become the reason of delay in his getting well .
Tambe has said that the maximum number of presence of microbes has been found in phones of the technicians .
After this the mobile phones of ward , nurse and then doctor were infected .
The chief of the microbiology department of the hospital Dr . Chitra said that the maximum 54 . percent stacillococcus acurus organisms have been found on the mobiles , which become the reason of skin disease .
Apart from this the organisms like e - coli and pseudomonas have also been found because of whose infection the ill effect on the body is maximum .
In one of the studies done in Coimbatore the presence of 96 . percent organisms was found on the phone of the hospital workers .
Sprouted cauliflower may protect from the cancer of stomach .
This fact has come up from one of the studies that by eating germinated cauliflower three days early keeps you miles away from stomach cancer , gastritis and ulcer .
Sprouted cauliflower destroys the microbes which give rise to these diseases .
According to the published study in the General Prevention Research of the American Association for Cancer Research situated in America by eating 70 gram quantity of germinated cauliflower regularly three days before finishes the effect of the organism named helicobacter pylori  H . pylori  .
H . pylori microbe is the maximum reason of the diseases related to stomach and the cancer of stomach .
Jade Fahe , the research associate of the faculty of the department of medicine science of the John Hopkins School of Medicine has said that it has been found from the study that with germinated cauliflower not only in animals but in man also it is capable of stopping cancer .
According to the study , the researchers selected a few from the 48 Japanese suffering from the helicobacter microbes and they were fed 70 grams of sprouted cauliflower for eight weeks and some were fed sprouted Alfa .
In the beginning of the study on these people the effect of these organisms was studied after four to eight weeks following it through various tests .
After eight weeks it was found less , however the effect of the microbes on the ones feeding on Alfa was fond to be the same .
New oral vaccine has been prepared for diarrhoea .
The National Institute of Disease , NICD Kolkata did test on 70 thousand people .
The cost of the dose of oral vaccine would be 40 - 50 rupees .
To prevent diarrhoea the chances of the oral vaccine to come early to the market has increased manifold .
The National Institute of Intric Disease has completed the successful test on around 70 thousand people .
70 percent cases have come positive in the test .
Although around one year of time may be required for the oral vaccine to come in the market .
The cost of the dose of the medicine may be between 40 to 50 rupees .
Not only in India but diarrhoea has become a serious problem also of the whole world .
Despite this there was no vaccine for the treatment of diarrhoea .
But after the untiring efforts of hundreds of researchers success has been achieved in the preparation of one more vaccine .
International Vaccine Institute Korea has manufactured this medicine .
To escape from the Indian market a national company has bought this formula .
The cost of this medicine would be one dollar per dose and any person would have to take two doses of it .
The effect of medicine will stay for two years .
In Vietnam the dose of vaccine has already been given to 90 lakh people and in Kolkata , India the trial has been done on 70 thousand people , in which the accuracy of the medicine has been found to be 70 percent .
In the program specialists from World Health Organisation , National Institute of Cholera and Intrinsic Disease Kolkata , ICMR , Department of Biotechnology of the Central Government and International Vaccine Institute Korea .
The experts have told that the first to prevent diarrhoea is oral vaccine .
Its maximum benefit would be in Orissa , West Bengal along with the people living in other coastal regions of the country and on international level Africa , Australia and people residing in the coastal areas in other countries , because the number of cases registered here is maximum .
Though this medicine can not be administered to children who are less than one year of age .
According to the figures of World Health Organisation the total number of case registered for cholera was one lac 77 thousand in the whole world and 4 thousand 31 people died because of this .
Because of unavailability of any vaccine to prevent this disease one has to depend only on the methods of precautions .
According to the World Health Organisation the effect of diarrhoea is seen more in coastal areas like Orissa , West Bengal , Gujarat and metropolitans like Delhi and Mumbai .
How can the diagnosis and treatment of cancer be done ?
Many times due to less information or carelessness the diagnosis of breast cancer is done late .
If you stay a little attentive then the treatment of breast cancer is possible timely .
Be cautious towards your body and get investigated by the doctor from time to time then riddance from breast cancer can be obtained easily .
If tumor is felt in breasts together with growth in the arm pits then be cautious .
Mild pain and swelling is felt on that place because of the growth of tumor .
Change comes in the breasts or their size .
At times wound appears on the place of swelling and then blood secretion starts from there .
When the tumor is on the upper and outer surface of the breast and there is secretion from the breast then immediately contact the doctor in such situation .
The tumor appears hard and there is no pain in it on touching .
The women who are more than thirty years of age should certainly themselves inspect their breasts once monthly seven days after the menstruation .
The stages of breast cancer are believed to be four .
But as the spreading of the wound increases its treatment becomes difficult .
In the fourth stage also if its treatment is done then success is achieved in 50 percent cases .
In the first and second stage the treatment is cent percent possible .
In the first stage the size of the tumor is less than two centimetres .
The tumor of two centimetres is not visible in any part of theory .
In the second stage the tumor grows to two to five centimetres big .
This reaches to the neighbouring gland of colourless fluid .
In the third stage the tumor grows to five cm and spreads to the skin and muscles of the body but does not reach up to the neighbouring gland .
In the fourth and very dangerous stage the tumor can be of any size .
The tumors do get affected by this and it also spreads to the other parts of the body .
As first surgery is done on the area with pain and then it is diagnosed that how big is the spread .
The conclusion may be wrong at the clinical stage but at the surgical stage the condition becomes very clear .
After the age of forty years the women should certainly get the mammography done .
In one mammography the expenditure comes to one thousand rupees .
Do not hesitate at all in getting mammography done .
Discuss about this , tell this to the members of the family and accumulate new information .
The treatment of breast cancer is expensive , which comes to one lac rupees .
But many charitable institutes are such which help immensely in this to the person .
Many help line services are also available for the treatment of breast cancer .
the treatment of cancer depends upon the age of the patient , the shape and spreading of the tumor formed in the breast .
Maximum women have to undergo surgery following which they are advised for anti cancer drug or hormone therapy .
Some women are advised for radiotherapy after the surgery so that the cancer is eliminated from the roots .
After the age of forty get mammogram done regularly or else do the inspection of your breast yourself after consulting the doctor .
If there is any type of tumor in the breast then immediately contact the doctor .
All the tumors are not cancerous but showing precaution is important .
If there is discharge of blood from the breast then immediately show to the doctor .
In the grown situation of the cancer the breast has to be removed partially or completely .
At present in place of the severed breast fake breast can be implanted through surgery .
The creation of breast is done with the tissues of the muscles of the patients only .
Since breast cancer is also dependent on the quantity of hormone in the blood , therefore the chances of cancer decreases on removing the uterus .
Whoever has got breast cancer once should not conceive in future , because by this there is a chance of breast cancer to start again .
In order to be safe from breast cancer it is important to bring change in ones food habits and physical and mental behavior as well .
Get your breasts checked up once in a month .
The benefit of this is that if you are suspicious then in the first stage only you will get to know about that and you will be saved from the danger forever .
Start the test seven days after the menstruation .
Toothache should not take away sleep .
The health of your entire body and beauty is connected with the health of teeth .
The aching of teeth is actually such pain which if happens to anybody then his sleep at night and the peace of daytime is lost .
If you want to escape from toothache then do not show even a slight carelessness in the care of teeth .
Although everyone know this that teeth are the very important part of the human body but still it has been seen that there are less than 20 % of the people who get the regular checkups of their teeth done .
65 percent of the children in our country don not get any type of dental care .
The effort should be this that cleaning teeth should be included in the habit of the child and later on it should not have any difficulty .
When the teeth of the children start coming out then it is required to keep special eye on them and to keep more information about teeth .
Often it has been seen that in this phase the children suck their thumb a bit more .
Actually they get relief by sucking their thumb .
If this habit of sucking thumb does not get over even by the age of four-five years then the case becomes serious .
The thumb starts weakening and it also has bad effect on the teeth as well .
In such case many times to give correct shape to the teeth many times the braces are needed .
It should not be such that in order to stop the thumb you give nipple to the child that also the honey one .
This will be even worse with him .
When the children of 12 to 18 months start walking then they also fall down several times .
Due to the falling of the children they also have to become victims of the injuries .
To whatever extent it is possible , save the children from falling .
In mild injuries the need to visit the doctor does not arise .
If the gums of the children get injured badly then you must take it to the dentist .
How should be the food of the children ?
The children should be given such snacks , in which there is no excessive sugar and they are non sticky .
The parts of sticky food items like lollypop , toffee etc get stuck to the gums and teeth of the children .
At this time everyone ignores this in laugh that the children do eat all these things and there is no effect , but later on this is included in their habit , whose maximum fine is borne by their teeth .
The mouth of children is filled by innumerable bacteria .
Whenever the children eat sweets , these bacteria also feed on them and in return release acid .
On an average the teeth start coming out in the age of six months .
During the six months when the teeth start becoming visible , clean them with wet clean clothes .
On becoming two years old start his brushing .
DO not give paste to the children before the age of seven years , because their teeth need fluoride after seven years only .
Yes , if you have to give the temptation of paste then put negligible paste on the toothbrush .
No matter how much the child protests , certainly clean his teeth .
If the bacteria start getting accumulated in teeth then getting rid of them would become difficult .
The biggest reason of the falling of teeth are these bacteria .
Due to the reason of bacteria the teeth of children fall rapidly in comparison to the elders .
To the children give the brush of their choice .
By doing such the children will show interest in brushing .
Try that the children should do the brushing with their own hands .
By cleaning your teeth you show to them that in what manner they should do the brushing .
You will be surprised to know that every year the teeth of thousands of children fall untimely , the chief reason of which is milk and the products made from milk .
Not wiping their mouth , not rinsing their mouth after making them eat something may become a lesson of problem for them in future .
Many mother-father feed milk to children when they are sleeping and the bottle stays stuck to their lips for hours , which in no way is a good situation .
This milk provides nutrition for long to the bacteria whose result are the cavities .
Later on what could be the situation of the teeth of these children , this can easily be imagined .
Give good toothpaste to the children .
Give only those toothpastes to children which are specially created by keeping their age in mind .
The brush should also be of good quality and its bristles should also be soft .
Save the children from any type of injury .
The teeth of children are extremely weak and there is also a big danger of their breaking on falling .
Take utmost care of baby teeth especially .
Often mother-father have the belief that the baby teeth have to go , even if they break untimely then also there is no effect , while this is not so .
These teeth give good look to the face and also give support to the gums and the teeth which would come out later on .
The new coming teeth take their place in the right manner , but if these teeth break untimely then the teeth which come out later on do not get good shape .
Keep the emergency number of the dentist written in the mobile and diary , no one knows when its need arises .
If the tooth gets broken suddenly on getting hit then go to the doctor immediately .
If the treatment of this broken tooth is done in an hour then the chances of its getting fixed again increases .
Otherwise many times the situation can be such that the tooth does not grow out again .
Fake tooth may be required to be put in future .
If the teeth of the children are paining in eating or drinking something then also take it to the doctor .
If the toothache is not treated in time then its ill effects can be on the nearby teeth and gums .
The dentist does its root canal by which the teeth are saved .
The part of teeth which is empty , the dentist does its crowning .
Through the intra-oral camera the dentist makes the patient familiar with all the activities inside his mouth .
This magnifies the mouth by 35 times and all the scenes within start moving in front of the eyes like a film .
The fiber optical headlight instrument which pierces the darkness of the mouth make she eyes of the dentist reach the inner parts mouth and gums .
Again then no disease stays hidden from him .
You must have often seen that doctors put something like spectacles on their eyes .
Actually this is the surgical telescope , by which the minute things of teeth and gums can be seen .
To investigate the mouth minutely digital x-ray proves to be of very high use .
These new digital x - ray machines consist of 50 to 90 percent less radiation in comparison to the old x-ray machines .
The best thing of digital x-ray is that by this the a very big image comes in front of the patient only that the dentist can discuss with him about every part of the mouth .
Zoom is type of whitening system which is safe , effective and absolutely fast as well .
In zoom procedure your teeth will become absolutely white and shiny in just an hour , while previously it used to happen such that the patient had to visit the doctor for several days .
Zoom is a very simple and painless procedure .
First it separates the lips and the gums then a whitening gel is released in between .
Five minutes after the fluoride treatment the process stops .
The whiteness of the teeth after this is unbelievable .
If you regularly take care of the teeth at home , then it will give you company for the entire lifetime .
To maintain the whiteness of the teeth is no difficult task .
You have to do only this that you should regularly consume asafoetida and strawberry .
Today an interesting thing has come into vogue , it is this that in order to save the patient from the boredom after sitting in the dental chair , music systems of various types have been put in several dental clinics .
The patient puts earphones and gets drowned in good music , then what does he care , the treatment of teeth goes on and he stays carefree .
If the treatment of teeth is not done on time then many diseases can surround you , you can even get cancer .
The infection of gums can also be lethal at times .
Because of rotten gums tonsil , infection in the bones and the entire body due to the transmission of blood can be negatively affected .
That is , if you are really worried about health then do not show any careless with regards to the care of the teeth .
When should you go to the dentist ?
If you go to the dentist after every six months then the disease can never come anywhere near the teeth .
If your gums are bleeding , the taste of the mouth becomes foul , if there is any disease related to mouth and teeth then certainly remember the dentist .
If you smoke then you must certainly be needing the dentist because smoking has a very bad effect on the gums , they become black and week .
If someone smokes in the house then remind him of the slogan of ` quit smoking ' .
If care lessens has not been shown in the cleanliness of the teeth then there is no need to worry .
The way in which cleanliness is required for each organ of our body , in the same way the teeth also need .
If the teeth give you problem then you entire body will cry out .
Develop the habit of cleanliness in the child from childhood only , so that they stay fit in future .

Because first the torn bristles may harm your teeth and gums and secondly bacteria start growing in them .
If you have cold then it would be good if you change your brush .
Your brush should be small .
Keep the bristles at the angle of 45 degree angle on the teeth .
make the brush move in a circular manner on gums and teeth .
With the help of the brush clean the teeth both inside and outside .

Certainly brush twice daily .
One should definitely brush for three minutes but keep in mind that excess pressure should not be exerted on the teeth .
Massage the gums with finger intermittently .
If brushing after breakfast is included in the routine then it would be the icing on the cake and one will also be free for the day .
Keep a wet clean handkerchief close by before feeding milk to the child .
Clean the gums and mouth very softly immediately after feeding milk to the child .
Never let the child go to sleep with the bottle of milk or juice in mouth .
the juice of fruits has natural sugar while the sugar contained in milk is called lactose .
If the lactose is left stuck to the tooth then it will inspire the bacteria to release lethal acid .
If the permanent tooth of the child falls after getting broken .
Pick the tooth and wash it properly with clean water .
Now wet the tooth in a glass of milk .
But one thing you should always keep in mind , do not touch the root of the tooth .
Within six hours get this tooth fixed at its right place .

Generally before implanting tooth the nearby good teeth are rubbed and then new tooth is fixed .
In the use of the technique named implant there is no need to fiddle with the nearby teeth .
Screw is fitted in the implant affected part and it is left to heal for four to six months .
After this pure titanium tooth is implanted over it which looks very real .
Though implant is a very costly treatment and the cost of one tooth implant comes to 15 to 20 thousand , but despite it , this technique is liked very much today .
This also has two reasons , one they look real and beautiful and second they become your own forever .

Some myths which disturb .
The eyesight becomes weak on the removal of the upper tooth , this myth is totally false .
Removal of tooth has got nothing to do with sight .
When the artificial set of teeth or denture is built for once then it comes to use for the entire lifetime .
But it is not at all like that , the tissues below the denture keep engine with time and the dentures do not fit and such dentures then do not stay hygienic , therefore the dentist advice to change it every five years .
If the treatment of damaged tooth is done once then all the problems of teeth and gums get over , but it is not like that .
Different yes of materials are used to correct the teeth and change comes in this material as well .
If the cleaning of that part is not done well then there stays a suspicion of rottenness within it .
Also the inspection of that corrected tooth once in a year is essential .
There are many types of disbeliefs regarding the health of the teeth .
Are you also not victim of any misbelieve ?
Scaling weakens the teeth , this is also a wrong belief .
Actually the teeth become weak only when the gums and teeth are not cleaned properly .
If the scaling of the teeth is not done regularly then the gums become weak and the teeth start falling after getting rotten .
The procedure for the treatment of teeth is painful , it is not at all like that .
The patient is given local anaesthesia due to which no matter what kind of treatment is done to the teeth there is no feeling of pain .

If the x-ray is not done in the initial three months of pregnancy then it would be good .
The teeth should be massaged with finger and not brush , this is also a false belief .
A brush having good bristles removes the food particles entangled in the teeth properly .
Massaging the gums with finger after cleaning the teeth with brush is beneficial .
It is not good to clean teeth with rice , salt and tobacco powder etc .
While the truth is that in good quality pastes there are such particles which are specially mixed for the teeth .
The loather formed out of paste destroys the bacteria on the teeth while because of these things the upper layer of the teeth becomes bad and the dirt on the teeth is also not removed .

You must have seen that at times in pregnancy or during delivery major faults occur .
By which danger occurs on the life of both mother and child .
What should be done in order to escape from these ?
At first always those matters should be kept in mind which are the symptoms of dangerous situation .
Like bleeding during pregnancy or delivery .
Persistence of pain for more than 12 hours or occurrence of fits .
In such situation immediately go to a big hospital without delay where all health services are got for free .
But are the whereabouts of the hospital known to you beforehand ?
Have you arranged for a vehicle to take the pregnant woman ?
Is the arrangement of money for fare and all with you ?
Have you arranged for blood ?
Lack or delay of anything in the hour of need may be saddening .
Therefore these arrangements must be done beforehand so that on need the pregnant women should be taken to the hospital immediately and every work gets completed nicely .
At times even after all the tests emergency situation arises during pregnancy .
At the time of birth of child the mother suffers from lengthy pains .
More than required lengthy pain may be dangerous .
Persistence of pain for more than 12 hours is a signal of danger .
At times the child is born inverted or abnormal , his hands - feet or any body part comes out first .
This situation may be very dangerous .
Without losing a moment make the pregnant woman reach the hospital .
Some other symptoms as well are the symptoms of danger .
If there are fits , there is feeling of stiffness , there is continuous headache , bleeding starts then do not delay at all and immediately get the tests done after going to a big hospital .
During delivery two more symptoms are the signals of serious danger .
During pregnancy deep red blood starts flowing in large quantity .
If the umbilical cord does not come out completely then immediately make the pregnant woman reach the hospital .
There could be delay in the preparation in the need of the hour and there could be danger to the life of both mother - child .
Make some arrangements in advance .

Make your husband or a responsible person of your family understand beforehand that in emergency situation , not to waste time in argument .
Immediately take the decision to go to the hospital .
Take full precaution even after delivery .
Do not show carelessness .
Keep an eye on the health of both mother - child .

There the doctor will do the test for this complication and will immediately do its treatment .
The arrangement of blood is a very important work .
During pregnancy there is often the deficiency of blood in women .
If any danger arises during delivery then excess blood may flow out of the body of mother .
In such situation it may be required to give her more blood .
In such time it is the moral responsibility of all the males of the household and the neighborhood to give blood .
Make your own brother , friend , family member or villagers ready beforehand for blood donation .
At least two blood donators definitely go to the hospital so that on requirement blood may be received by the pregnant woman .
One important thing - there is no weakness in the body by giving blood and the same blood is manufactured in the body again in half an hour .
Green vegetable , pulses , lentils are qualitative for mother - child therefore during pregnancy eat nutritious food and in right quantity .
Do not do any abstinence in the case of food .

Iron elements are found in high quantity in green leafy vegetables and lentils .
In cereals iron elements are found in wheat , jowar , bajra , pulses with peels and jaggery .
In non vegetarian food items like meat , liver etc . also iron elements are found in enough quantity .
Therefore you must eat these things of iron elements .
Even eat vegetables and lentils of green leaves every alternate day .
Pregnant women should not drink tea before and after meals .
Due to the consumption of tea the use of iron elements found in food does not take place completely .
Lemon , orange , guava , raspberry and raw mango with meals increases the use of this iron element in the body .
Eating tablets given by A . . . sister  Anganwadi activist is also very necessary for not letting the blood lack in body .
If the child falls sick then should consumption be stopped ?
If the child odes not eat then would he not become weak ?
Therefore on child falling sick also do not stop feeding food to him .
As you would have already seen that in illness the child behaves of the age younger to his age .
In such condition you will have to give more attention to the child .
It may be that you will have to feed the child with your hand little by little .
If the child drinks milk then make him drink milk regularly .
For becoming alright the body of the child needs strength and that strength is obtained from your milk or food only .
In such condition do not show carelessness , in sickness keep giving food to the weak child .
With this the child gets help in becoming alright fast .
After becoming alright make the child eat more food than his average dose , for at least one weak so that the weakness produced due to illness may be reduced .
Dirty utensils and dirty hands spread disease .
Wash hands with soap and keep nails short .
After toilet or after cleaning the child ' s toilet certainly wash hands with soap .

Contraceptives have given new description to women and new dimension as well .
Especially because of the contraceptive pills they got the right to take the decision on their own to give birth to the child .
Apart from healthy and active life to women the contraceptives have also given this self confidence that they themselves have the right on their body .
Contraceptives have helped in making life of women simple .
Now they are capable of living their life according to their own wish .
When they want children , how many children , whether they want or not , they can decide this with the help of their life partner .
Birth of child is now not her compulsion , it is her own decision .
She has also proved to be a good mother by this .
A healthy woman , consisting of self confidence only can give a better future to the society .
The woman plays an important role in the betterment of own child and the entire family through less children and proper gap in the age of children and in this contraceptives help her in every step .
The history of contraceptives is also told to be very old , despite this they got a developed form in this century only .
More important than this is that first time the identity of women got approval in the form of a human being .
What is conception ?
When the sperms of man meet with the ovum of woman then conception takes place .
But before this conception many situations are formed .
Firstly the sperms reach the uterus by going through the vaginal canal and enter the fallopian tube .
Here in the broad portion of the tube there is mating with the developed eggs which comes out of the ovary .
On entering the eggs sperms mix their chromosomes with the egg .
The egg gets fertilized and after developing gets converted into a multicelled ball which is called blastocyst .
This gets attached to the surface of the uterus .
The contact with the muscles of the tube and the cilia lining as thin as hair advance the egg towards uterus .
The egg does not advance on its own .
Every month many eggs are developed but in hair follicle only one egg is able to develop .
The other eggs get squeezed on their own .
Lakhs of sperms enter the uterus but maximum get destroyed due to the reason of the acidic substances inside .
One or two out of whatever sperms escape get attached to the outer layer of the egg and the moment conception takes place , it puts a ban on the entry of other sperms .
Following situations come in conception .
Sperms passes through the uterus and goes to the fallopian tube .
The egg enters the tube .
The sperm makes the egg conceive .
The zygote gets divided into two .
64 cells of zygote enter inside the uterus .
This gets converted into a seed .
On reaching its destination the seed gets connected with the surface of the uterus .
Here it gets nutritive substances from the blood cells of the mother .
Related to the menstrual cycle generally women have this misbelief that it is dirty blood and the more it flows out of the body the better it is .
But this is a very wrong misbelief .
Actually the reason of menstruation is the destruction of inner wall of skin inside the uterus , that is , the endometruim line .
The thinner this wall would be , that much less would be the flow of blood .
Because of excess flow there is a deficiency of iron elements in the body of the woman and the woman becomes victim of anemia .
Actually menstrual cycle is one such physical change in the body of women which comes entirely within the system of reproduction and is very important for reproduction .
The menstruation coming every month is the time between the onset of puberty and menarche .
During the menstrual cycle from the body of fully mature woman during ovulation ovum is released , with this the lining of uterus , endometrium develops that time only .
After ovulation this lining prepares the reproduced egg and conception takes place .
If conception does not take place then a new menstrual cycle starts .
This is the part of the endometrium and blood products which comes through the passage of vagina .
Generally the menstrual cycle is of 28 days .
It has three phases - in first phase menstruation  from 1 up to 5 days  .
In the second phase the hormone cycle  from 6 up to 13 days  .
The third phase suitable for reproduction  14 to 28  .
Before the start of menstruation many changes in the hormones take place , whose maximum effect is seen on the behavior of the women , like the increase of irritation , some stiffness in breast , increase of weight , swelling etc .
Because of the reason of the bursting of ovarian cyst many times there is sudden pain in abdomen .
Many times blood also starts flowing heavily , the reason of occurrence of both these complications together is soreness in genitals .
But there is no need to panic in this because these diseases become alright easily by proper treatment .
Generally there is a misbelief that four days prior to menstruation , four days of menstruation and four days after menstruation are very safe , but this is possible only when your menstruation is regular .
The second method is that everyday the woman takes her temperature and notes that in a diary .
The day on which temperature rises by one degree then believe that egg has been produced this day .
Five days before and after this day are said to be unsafe .
By recording the temperature for three - four months the woman can easily get to know her unsafe days easily .
Various methods are present for contraception , you have to choose according to your ease .
Because of not using the methods of contraception children are born one after the other and by becoming victim of malnutrition go to the embraces of death .
In the entire world death of around 60 thousand children takes place , out of this 99 percent deaths occur only in developing countries .
The mother and child should stay healthy and fit and proper gap should be there between two children , for all these it is important that methods of contraception should be used .
For men condom is very cheap and is a simple option and it also saves them from many infections .
There should be knowledge of the method of its proper use .
Apart from this because of this the woman has to depend completely on the man .
After discharging instead of putting the semen in the woman ' s vagina he throws it outside .
Though it is a good and free of cost option , but because of this the danger of conception is maintained without interruption .
In the process of vasectomy also that passage is closed without incision through which the sperms flow .
What is to be understood is that only the passage is closed .
This is a small work of 15 minutes .
By coming on his own the person can go back home on his own .
After vasectomy he can do his daily work as usual .
In vasectomy one precaution has to be taken , for the next three months while doing intercourse condom has to be used .
After vasectomy on the interval of one month and then in the third month coming for the doctoral test is important and after the doctoral report intercourse can be done without any tension without any condom .
But for this men do not agree easily .
The options for contraception for women .
Women can use pills , cream , jelly , sponge etc . which are put in the genitals so that semen can not go inside .
The pills are put some minutes before intercourse or on need may be put one hour before .
During six hours if intercourse is done again then it is important to put the tablet again in the genital .
Copper T is a good option , these are of several types .
Copper T 200 - this may be put for three years .
Copper T 380 A - this may be put for ten years .
Multiload copper T 250 and 375 - this may be put for five years .
By this technique semen may be stopped from coming inside .
But get the copper T fixed only when there is no pregnancy .
As menstruation starts or as it ends you may get it fixed .
After getting the copper T fixed there is no need to use any other contraceptive option at all .
After getting the copper T fixed get the doctoral check up done certainly in the interval of one month and then three months and then every six months .
In market some emergency contraceptive pills are available .
These are such pills which are taken in emergency that is then when conception takes place by mistake .
These should be taken between 72 hours of conception .
After this take five days morning - evening .
Taking two pills immediately during conception morning - evening and two pills 12 hours after pregnancy the risk of pregnancy is averted .
When the family is completely planned , then through surgery also women may get rid of pregnancy forever .
This is done in two ways - first through telescope and second by cutting the stomach slightly .
By telescope the fallopian tube is either tied or destroyed .
By incising the stomach also this process may be done .
Both these processes are painless and hundred percent successful contraceptives .
At our place since long intercourse is done by calculating the days which is considered a successful contraceptive option to a great extent .
Apart from this regular and uninterrupted breast feeding is also considered to be a good contraceptive .
In today ' s modern world though there are options one after the other like condom , pills which are kept in the genitals , copper T , etc , but the most effective options are contraceptive pills .
Contraceptive pills are those pills which are eaten which women find the most comforting .
In modern times Karl Deresy is considered to be the genitor of contraceptive pills .
These pills on going to the body of the female stop the female from conceiving .
Because of pills no new eggs are formed in the body of the female .
In the contraceptive pills of yesteryears the quantity of estrogen and progesterone used to be very high which had several ill effects .
But in modern pills there is no such danger .
These pills provide cent percent protection to the woman .
By this the menstrual cycle becomes regular .
The pain and blood flow occurring these days also reduces by which the complaint of anemia does not occur .
Apart from this , protection from the tumor of the breast etc . also takes place .
In 1970 some sort of reduction in the level of hormone had been brought .
After this its as if the standard of contraceptive pills have started improving .
Today these pills have only been considered to be the best contraceptives .
Some times back from now there used to be 21 days and 28 days course of contraceptive pills .
For 21 days one pill only had to be taken daily according to fixed time .
Now the pill to be taken once a week has also come .
These contraceptive pills are easily available in the market which may be bought from any chemist .
These pills may be bought from any medical store .
Related information is attached with these contraceptive pills .
Obesity does not only make the personality unattractive , it even attracts many diseases .
How should be the lifestyle for staying fit ?
No one wants that there should be useless fat on his body but due to carelessness in lifestyle weight starts increasing and many types of diseases start surrounding .
Today piling up of fat on body is a universal problem .
It should in fact be said that in case of obesity India is slowly on path of America .
Here obesity is given the status of disease .
Here every third person is victim of obesity .
If said in the language of the doctors , then any person becomes obese when in comparison to the calorie used by him he consumes calorie in more quantity through the medium of food and other food materials .
This imbalance in the consumed and used calorie may arise due to various reasons .
Now this depends on the particular person that which reason is responsible for him becoming fat .
Obesity may also happen due to hereditary reasons .
Although this is also a fact that the food habits and life style of some families are the ones which increase obesity .
But despite this , it has been proved in researches that somewhere the biological makeup of human body is also responsible for obesity .
Especially for adopted children it has already been proved that there is much closeness in their weight and the weight of their real parents in comparison to the weight of their adopted parents .
Environmental reasons also become a cause for obesity .
In this the lifestyle and food related habits are included .
What any person eats and how much he is involved in physical activity , it has a direct relation with his health , especially the weight of the body .
If he does not burn the calorie received through food , then extra calorie starts accumulating in his body in the form of fat .
And lastly the result is the person becoming victim of obesity .
Today people eat a lot of fast food and fried things but save their skin from labor .
At homes modern instruments are present for the help of women , then children keep sitting in front of TV , computer for hours .
Not only this their mouth is always full with chips , chocolates and other market things .
On the other hand seven - eight hours of a day of office going women - men are spent sitting on the chair .
What is meant by saying is that the opportunities for man to be included in physical activities are becoming less and less and the consequences are in front .
Even the smell of food makes the person obese .
Many times even when there is no hunger he comes towards the food attracted with the smell and in return he gets more calorie than the required .
Psychological reasons also become the cause of obesity .
On being mentally unhealthy also there is tendency of man to eat more .
Especially , on being victim of tension , sadness , anger or inferiority complex not only do the people eat more , but at regular intervals they also get the urge to eat something or the other .
This way they not only receive calorie in high quantity but by repeated eating the eaten food also does not get digested and the rate of their digestion  the rate of the consumption of energy  becomes disrupted .
In such situation it becomes a difficult task for them to get rid of obesity .
But it is seen up to the extent that the enthusiasm towards life in the person disturbed mentally diminishes .
And in such situation he becomes depressed towards keeping himself fit or to reduce obesity .
The diseases occurring due to obesity .
Heart attack , sugar  type B  , stone in gall bladder , high blood pressure etc .
many types of cancer like cancer of intestine and prostrate in men , then the cancer of reproductive organs , uterus , ovary , breast and gall bladder etc .
The disease of joints , the disease of liver , sleep apnia that is obstruction in breathing for some moments during sleep .
In women the irregularity of menstruation and infertility etc happen .
Some special types of diseases also make the body of the person fatty .
Hypothyroidism , depression , consumption of steroids or anti - depressant medicines are some such situations , when fat starts building up on the body of the person .
In women they have seen to become fat especially on the occurrence of the complication of thyroid or after the surgery of uterus .
Similarly after delivery also they become fat in an abnormal way .
Although their weight starts increasing during pregnancy , but this is the stage of overweight , not that the quantity of fat starts increasing on the body .
While after giving birth to the child fat only increases on their body , gaining control over which is many times beyond their limits .
Often the meaning of obesity for people is the increase of weight , but this is not the right definition of obesity .
According to medical experts , in the increased weight the weight of everything like muscles , bones , fat and water are included .
While with obesity the meaning is - accumulation of fat in body in proportion higher than a certain quantity .
That is the direct relation of obesity is with fat , not with the increased weight of the body .
Like if we consider body builders and athletes then their weight is very high .
Despite this body builders and athletes are not fat .
Body builders and athletes are stay absolutely fit and healthy .
But this does not mean at all that fat is bad every ways .
It is important that in every human being there should be fat in certain quantity for storage of energy in the body , for the maintenance of enough heat , to bear the shocks from outside or to other such important works .
You are fat or whether you are fat or not , to know this it is important to know BMI or body mass index .
The easy way to know BMI is - BMI = weight  height  square meter  .
If the BMI is between 25 and 29 . , then it is considered that the weight of the person is more , while people with BMI of 30 or more than 30 are called obese .
Though BMI is incapable of saying this that in a person the quantity of fat is more or that of muscles , bones , fat , and water etc .
Then also with its help the quantity of fat can be estimated to a very great extent .
To know this together with the weight of the person his height  in square meter  is also needed and in height all the organs of the person are included to a very great extent .
There is no alternative to exercise in reducing obesity , But if you feel that strolling morning - evening is exercise then it is completely wrong .
With exercise the meaning is - to bring the heart rate to the level of 75 percent to its rate after doing exercise for 20 to 60 minutes .
Like if your age is 40 years , then your desired heartbeat rate is 220 - 40 = 180 .
Your level of exercise is its 75 percent , that is it should be 135 par minute .
For this anything in cycling , jogging , aerobics may be included in the daily routine .
Together with this do yogay , also meditation , but while doing exercise you must keep certain thing in mind .
Certainly do ` warm up ' five minutes before exercise and ` cool up ' after it .
For heart patients walking fast , jogging or brisk walking are the best exercise , but if their has been a heart attack recently or there has been a bypass surgery , then definitely take the advice of the doctor before exercising .
With this keep in mind the following things in the daily routine .
Increase the duration of exercise gradually .
take deep breaths while exercising , but pay attention not to stop breathing .
keep at least an interval of one hour between meal and exercise .
Do not exercise when you are sad , in tension or angry .
Adopt controlled lifestyle .
Smoking , drinking , mental tension fuel the fire , therefore escape from them .
If you are suffering from some psychological disorder or the disorder of overeating , then contact the psychologist or psychiatrist in time .
Because of more than required weight , children are becoming victims of the diseases which occur in adults .
Increasing obesity in children ahs come up in the form a serious problem .
Children are becoming victims of diseases like diabetes .
It has become very important to control obesity .
doctors believe that the treatment of obesity should be done in childhood only .
Because due to obesity on growing up diseases like heart problem , diabetes and high blood pressure start cropping up .
In maximum children the complaint of obesity is seen in the age of 2 . years .
During this time the weight of children is more than their age , the chance of whose reduction diminish with increasing age .
In countries like India increasing urbanisation and globalisation have pit a deep impact on the food habits of children .
Today children relish the fun of TV , video game , DVD and other electronic gadgets for hours , because of which their sports have reduced .
Also with this the consumption of junk food has also increased in children , the cholesterol , and sugar which are found in them only become the main reason in increasing the quantity of calorie in the body .
Because of the reason of these junk food only around 10 to 20 percent children in India become the victims of obesity .
By 2030 approximately half of the children of the country will come in the clutches of this disease .
In a survey done recently this thing has come up that in the last 50 years the consumption of oily substances in Indian children has increased 20 percent .
In children eating candy , chocolate , pizza , hotdog , French fries and sweets the number of children in the age from 11 to 20 years is told to be around 80 percent , there the number of children from 9 - 11 years is told to be approximately 25 percent .
First a ban should be imposed on the canteens in the schools of children which sell junk food .
Apart from this at home mother - father should pay special attention on the food habits of children , by which they eat fibrous fruits and vegetables in more quantity leaving the fatty food .
The government of every country should put a prohibition on the advertisements of junk food that are shown on the TV .
Especially that time when children are watching programs on the TV .
In every school the period of yoga , exercise and PT should certainly be organised because of which their outdoor activity increases .
Also with this it is important to highlight their performance in the report card of the children , by which they themselves also stay alert .
the moment the eye of any person falls on the increased fat of his body , then immediately his attention goes towards his food and he starts dieting .
While for reducing the quantity of fat the requirement is of balanced diet .
Therefore , firstly get your check up done , so that it is assured that the weight is not increasing because of any disease .
Get a diet chart made from the dietician according to your height , weight , age , sex and routine that how much calorie you should consume through your food daily .
For your convenience some suggestions to control calorie are like this .
keep an account of you food and physical activities .
Mind it that in return to the eaten things you have done labor .
If you like eating ice then eat it after taking out the rice water .
Drink at least two litres of water everyday .
Consume seasonal fruits - vegetables in more and more quantity and consume fruits - vegetables of dark color more and more quantity and certainly eat the fruits - vegetables of dark color but eat less sweet fruits .
Do not eat mango , banana , sapota and grapes .
Eat more salad and use sprouted pulses also in this .
Always eat thin dal and eat dal with peels moong dal , horse gram dal .
For chapatti instead of using flour of mill use thick flour made in millstone with the bran .
This mixture of cereals does not let fat increase on the body .
Bring in use toned milk and instead of curd bring in use curd water mixed with black salt and carom seeds .
For cooking bring in use such oil , in which there is less cholesterol like soya bean or oil of corn .
If there is desire to eat sweets then eat such sweets , in which there has been no use ghee like petha in place of gulab jamun .
Consume less and less of fast food , meat , ghee , oil maida , sugar and dry fruits .
Consume less salt .
The direct relation of obesity is with our food habits , but the important thing is ` right eating ' not ` less eating ' .
The use of bypass surgery in the treatment of heart diseases is not very old .
This has proved to be a boon for the heart patients .
The obstruction created in the originating part of all the major arteries can be treated with bypass surgery .
Through the coronary angioplasty method a tube is made to reach the arteries of the heart through the medium of the starting point .
A balloon is fixed on this tube .
While putting the tube inside the balloon is deflated .
Studying the path of this tube on television it is taken to the place of obstruction .
Right at the pace of obstruction the balloon is inflated .
By this the obstruction in the arteries of the heart open up .
Then the tube is taken out .
There are many benefits of this method like less expenditure , no need of surgery , there is no danger of infection as well and even one does not have to stay in the hospital for more days .
But this technique can not be brought into use for all the patients .
In opening up blocked arteries E . . . proves fruitful .
E . . .  external counter pulsation  is one such technique through the medium of which the blocks occurring in the arteries can easily be removed .
The moment the obstruction of the arteries are removed the transmission of blood in the body increases .
In the medical process of E . . . set of three soft strips  compressive cuffs  is tied on the knees , lower thighs , upper thighs and hips of the patient .
This soft strip keeps inflating and deflating regularly .
During this entire process these strips by putting pressure on thighs and hips increase the diastolic coronary perfusion pressure because of which reduction comes in the pressure exerted on the heart .
E . . . Treatment process is very simple and easy .
This treatment is given to the patient only for an hour .
In total this process continues for 35 hours in 7 weeks .
The patient is neither made unconscious during this nor any kind of medicine is given to him .
During the entire process of E . . . The patient feels very easy .
In the immediate diagnosis of heart attack apart from E . . . And some special tests of blood at present a special type of camera is brought into use .
By this camera how much part of the heart has been damaged , this can be known .
The destroyed muscles of the heart may be diagnosed with the help of gamma camera .
According to the heart specialists , immediately after heart attack more damage occurs in the heart by the accumulation of blood clots in the coronary arteries .
The clot of blood if accumulates on the upper part of the artery then the heart attack becomes serious .
Because in the upper part of the arteries only the flow of blood is more .
On the accumulation of blood clot in the lower part or the last part of the artery the heart attack does not become serious .
Due to the reasons of the newest technique of medical science removal of blood clots now has become very easy .
In the decade of eighties two injections were developed by the American medical scientists to remove these clots which are called ` streptochynas ' and ` urochynas ' .
For the patients of heart these injections have proved to be a boon .
In the cardiac medical science this technique is known by the name of ` thrombocytic therapy ' .
But today for the diagnosis of the diseases of the heart newer techniques better than the other are available .
The myth that after heart attack life becomes worthless , useless and meaningless has changed now very fast .
After becoming alright the patient may join their work .
The malfunctioning in the muscles of the heart may also be made alright like other diseases .
Rehabilitation is very important for the patients of the heart .
The meaning of rehabilitation is to make the patient capable of working again , removal of mental tension and making him able to lead normal life .
Often after heart attack mental tension and fear start bothering the patient .
For leading a normal life it is important to remove such apprehensions .
There are three important stages of rehabilitation .
In the first stage it is important to remove the fear of becoming incapable or death from the mind of the patient .
Also with this any kind of pressure exerted on the heart is tried to remove .
This is that stage when the patient is made healthy mentally .
The initiation of making the patient disease free completely takes place in the second stage .
In this the person comes out of the bed and also starts climbing up some stairs gradually and at the end he comes back .
The complete effort of the doctor is this that once again the patient becomes a healthy and active citizen of the society .
In the third stage it is tried to make the patient physically and mentally completely healthy .
In the SAAOL natural medication keep the heart disease free .
Today the number of heart patients is increasing at a fast pace .
Medical science has also gone very far in this direction .
With techniques like angioplasty , bypass surgery the successful treatment of heart disease is possible .
But various research studies on the heart patients reveal that by taking slight precaution in one 's life pattern , style of living and food habits and by doing yoga and exercise the danger of many types of diseases may be averted .
the alternative of natural medication is beneficial .
the number of heart patients are increasing everyday .
People have to undergo expensive and risky surgeries .
At times one does not get much time between heart attack and heart fail that the patient may be saved depending on the doctor .
But bring such changes in the lifestyle that these types of complications do not come then it would be even better .
According to the verdict of Dr . Vimal Chhajed the director and the heart specialist of SAAOL heart center of Delhi the alternative of natural treatment is the most beneficial for the patients of heart .
After getting the important tests for coronary heart disease the advice for surgery is given to the patient .
Even after getting the surgery done the patients has to come to the hospital again after two - four years .
Even after such dangerous surgeries when the patient feels complications then the advice to consume the medicine by increasing its dose is given .
If the patient adopts the habit of staying continuously in neural and beautiful environment of nature and uses vegetarian food then the permanent diagnosis of these problems may happen .
Consume less oil and fat in food .
By doing yoga morning - evening , and doing sahaj exercise benefit is received .
Actually this is a natural treatment whose effect provides the body with the ability to make it free of all bodily diseases .
SAAOL that is , science and art of living , is a technique of treatment of heart based on natural treatment .
Under the SAAOL heart program the patents are not just given immediate relief but its permanent solution is done through natural medicine .
under the SAAOL natural treatment at first the importance of vegetarian food is told .
Then under SAAOL natural treatment habits of yoga in morning - evening and meditation etc are adopted .
In this treatment there is neither the need of eating medicine nor of getting surgery done .
Under this medication a training of three days is given to the heart patient .
The patients are kept in natural places away from the population .
During the training the habit of eating vegetarian food of less fat and to endure tension are taught .
Under this treatment along with yoga practice scientific information related to heart disease are also given .
That is , during this training the art of new balanced and natural life style is taught to the patient .
Balanced and fatless food and regular exercise become his daily routine .
Why is natural treatment esteemed ?
We have made even more than two and half thousand heart patients disease free with this natural treatment method .
In comparison to the availability of many types treatment methods and new medicines in modern medical technique the natural treatment method is more fruitful and beneficial .
After getting the treatment done through the natural treatment technique the patient becomes completely disease free .
The special thing with natural treatment technique is this that the person adopts such habit that other diseases do not ever cross his path .
Those people who after taking the training of natural treatment technique continue following its rules , the danger of heart problems can never occur to them .
Pimples of the head may make bald .
No matter in which part of the body the pimples develop , they are painful .

Because of the biting and wastes of lice the deformity of arunshika with itching develops .
The lice which produce arunshika are called ` pedi culus capiris ' .
The deformity of arunshika happens due to the infection of pedi culus capiris .
In order to destroy the deformity of the pimples of the head hair must be cleaned properly .
For the cleanliness of the scalp long hair should be cut short .
On getting the hair cut with blade its treatment takes place easily .
After getting the hair cut the head should be washed morning - evening with water mixed with dettol .

Handicapness in itself is a curse , either it is of limbs or mental .
It is very difficult to estimate the physical suffering , helplessness , worthlessness , negligence etc . Occurring due to handicapness .
Only those can know this whose children have become victims of dangerous diseases like paralysis  polio  unknowingly .
It is the primary duty of every mother - father to get the child injected with the vaccine of polio in order to save from handicapness .
Out of six dangerous diseases occurring in childhood is polio which is called ' baal pakshaghaat ' in Ayurveda .
Those children who get this disease , their mother - father do not know anything related to this from the beginning .
Objectively : by knowing its initial form - symptom and by maintaining caution we can save the child from being polio infested .
Child polio disease at first infects the digestive system .
Its viruses reach the intestine by entering in the digestive system through the nose and mouth .
Staying in the intestine they continue to grow .
Then these viruses after getting mixed with blood damage the nerve cells of the vertebral column on reaching the central nervous system .
As a result to this the disease of polio appears .
Although the chance of reaching these viruses to the brain is just one percent .
But that same one percent becomes the reason of polio in child .
In Ayurveda it is called shaishawiya pakshawadha , baal pakshaaghaat or adharaang - waat .
This means the upper or lower part of the body becoming inactive or sensation less .
No work can be performed from the polio infested part .
There remains no voluntary control over that part .
Polio is a quick developing contagious disease .
Polio occurs due to three types of polio viruses .
Which are called polio myelitis type  polio myelitis virus type  1 . . .
In human species the disease of polio occurs due to the first and third type of the viruses .
The polio viruses do not die quickly .
Polio spreads from one person to the other .
After the infection through the medium of stool or else mouth , the discharge of nose it spreads quickly in intestine and throat .
The entry of polio in body is through several media , getting hurt , injection , through tonsil , during surgery etc .
It has been seen such that in the last stage of pregnancy in a pregnant woman the chance of its infection is high .
The easiest medium of its infection is - drinking water , food , milk , eating with dirty hands , surrounding dirt etc .
Not just this the virus of polio spreads from one patient to the other patient also through coughing , sneezing and phlegm .
The beginning of polio is similar to the symptoms of influenza .
The attack of the disease of polio is often sudden .
In the beginning the child may get mild fever , after this there may be paralysis in the patient .
The incubation period of the disease of polio is considered to be 3 to 12 days .
the symptoms of the disease generally appear according to the various conditions .
In the beginning of the disease fever , headache , pain in various body parts , cough - cold , digestive problems etc .
Able doctors also often fail to know that the child is about to contract polio .
After some days these symptoms are removed .
But after 7 . days the symptoms of polio appear .
The vertebral column gets stiffened due to the occurrence of fever , vomiting , dysentery , restlessness , pain , injury in the layer of the brain .
Because of the reason of polio the child has a lot of difficulty in bringing his knee to the mouth while sitting .
Because of the complication in urinary bladder the urine stops or comes out in less quantity accompanied with pain .
After two days even this symptom goes away .
The fever goes down but deformity comes in the legs and feet of child .
In 2 to 5 days of the beginning of his disease the symptom of paralysis start appearing in his legs and hands .
The polio diseases continues to increase for three days .
7 . days after the beginning of the polio disease the condition of the patient starts improving .
In paralysis the muscles of legs or arms get slackened .
Later on the muscles of these organs start drying up .
But the disease of some children even start reducing gradually .
On the disease not getting corrected the hands or feet or both the organs of the child become incapable of movement and locomotion .
As there is attack of polio on the child the affected organ becomes inactive , dried or lean - thin .
Due to the reason of polio the growth of the child stops .
The child becomes lethargic and the intelligence growth of the brain generally gets retarded or blocked .
Due to the reason of polio fingers along with hand - feet , joints , thighs , breast , waist area , vertebral column etc also get deformed .
When the disease gets old on not getting it timely treatment done then its extremely lethal effect falls on spinal nerves and vertebrae of the vertebral column .
For protection against it the dose and vaccine of polio are important .
In order to escape from this awful and dangerous disease giving dose of polio to child is important .
From the age of six months up to nine months of his age at the interval of one month each administer five doses to the child .
Get the first dose only of polio , second , third , fourth triple K . injection with polio and the fifth the dose of polio alone .
The first booster dose between one and half to two years of age and second booster dose between four and half to five years of age should be administered only once .
At present two types of polio vaccine are brought in use for the protection against this disease - salk vaccine and sabin vaccine .
The use of salk vaccine is done thrice in muscles through injection .
First injection in the quantity of 1 m . . six weeks after this second and the third injection is given after 7 to 9 months .
With this vaccine for around four years immune power develops against its virus .
In this vaccine all the three types of viruses stay mixed  diphtheria , tetanus and polio  .
The creation of sabin vaccine is also through three viruses .
There is the provision of making the use of sabin vaccine through mouth at the interval of every 1 month continuously for three months three times in total .
2 portions of 3 drops each of sabin vaccine is given empty stomach after mixing in khand with water or milk .
the immune power in sabin vaccine is maintained for around 8 years .
Thus by making use of the polio vaccine according to rules the child may be saved from being infested with polio .
According to Ayurveda the treatment of polio is done in two ways - internal treatment and external treatment .
In the internal treatment the use of powder , paste , aasaw , juice and burnt ashes are done .
While in the external treatment exercise , postures , oil massage , pack and swedan etc should be adopted .
There is benefit by massaging and fomentation on the polio infested organ .
For massage bala oil , mash oil should be used .
For locomotion arrangements may be done for hand vehicle or tricycle or special type of shoes .
Some beneficial tips for the disease of polio are of the following types .
By taking urad , pure kaunch and root of erand in equal proportion boil it in sixteen times of water .
Remove it on the remainder of quarter part water .
Then mix two pinches of clothfitered powder of asafoetida and aniseed into it and keep .
Taking 1 . spoon from it make the child drink 4 . times a day .
Make powder of everything pippalamul , chita mul , pippali , dry ginger and sea salt in equal quantity .
The total weight of all the powders should be 20 grams .
Then cook it on mild temperature after mixing 1500 m . . of urad soup and 500 m . . of sesame oil .
When only oil is left then filter it after removing .
Taking this oil in the quantity of 1 spoon make the child drink this after mixing in milk .
This oil may also be used for massage .
Massage this on the entire body of the child .
Make him lie for 15 - 20 minutes bare body in the morning sunlight .
This oil is also found in the Ayurvedic medical store with the name of ' maha mash tel ' .
Make use of mahayograj guggul up to 120 to 240 m . . with maharasnadi kwath 15 - 25 m . . morning - evening .
After this give 1 to 2 grams of rason pind with water .
In the affected area mahamash oil and vishgarbha oil  by mixing both in equal quantity  should be massaged twice daily .
No matter how much busy you are , it is important that you must take out time for physical exercise .
Go for walks in the morning and evening .
Stroll after meal at night .
If you are in the office , then climb through stairs instead of lift .
In every five minutes walk for five minutes .
By the way it is said that in a day one should certainly exercise for at least 30 minutes .
With this on one hand your blood circulation will stay normal , on the other hand your cholesterol etc will also not increase .
Keep an eye on eating - drinking .
If you want to stay healthy then for this the most important thing is your food - drinks .
If your fooding habit is not correct , then you may become victim of malnutrition , hypertension , anemia , blood sugar etc .
Say like this that your complete lifestyle gets affected with this .
Keep away from chaat - pakora or junk food .
Consume food materials containing iron compounds , calcium , magnesium , mineral and vitamin in high quantity .
With the consumption of fibrous fruits and vegetables many disease stay away on their own .
The extent to which the need of heart and body is important for men it is also for women .
The thread of life of man is tied to heart .
Till the time the heart stays healthy the life of man goes on smoothly .
Otherwise on the heart being disease infested he comes in the clutches of many types of heart related diseases .
Generally it is considered that the direct relation of heart diseases is with the increase in cholesterol .
As the quantity of cholesterol increases in body , the danger bell for heart gets rung .
But in modern experiments one such element has come to be known , which is considered to be far more lethal to the heart than the cholesterol .
This substance is - amino acid named homocystin which is four times more sticky substance than cholesterol .
This gets produced in the body during the process of digestion of food only without protein .
If its quantity gets increased in the body , then ill effects like blockage in the arteries , reduction in the work capacity of blood vessels have to be faced .
Apart from this because of the increase of homocystin alone many lethal effects have to be faced .
Like reduction in the capacity of blood clotting .
With increase in homocystin more production of bad cholesterol .
By repairing the DNA the work of homocystin stops .
Consequently , disturbance in the genetic construction of the person and the continuation of the disease of increased production of homocystin generation by generation .
On the occurrence of homocystin in pregnant woman abortion , premature delivery , less weight of the child , the feet of the child being joined , line in the middle of the lips etc . may occur .
The quantity of homocystin keeps increasing for the entire life time .
The quantity of homocystin at least becomes twice from childhood to old age .
The quantity of homocystin is more in comparison to women right from youth .
But the quantity of hommocystin gradually goes on decreasing with increasing age .
In fact the problem of increase of homocystin is found more in the age group of 20 - 30 years and is seen more in men .
In this also the percentage of Indians with this problem is more .
In the blood of man 5 - 15 MOL  L homocystin should be there .
If homocystin is found even 5 percent more in man then the chance of heart attack increases three times .
Because of increase in homocystin the chances of death increases 50 percent due to disease of heart and 20 percent due to brain and neural diseases .
Therefore those people who have a family history of heart disease , for then getting the homocystin test may prove to be blessing .
The reasons for increase of homocystin is obesity , diabetes , high blood pressure , smoking etc .
Apart from this consumption of more coffee and alcohol .
Less walking , increase in bad cholesterol in blood .
Not taking nutritious food , epilepsy , some medicines given for the treatment of sugar etc .
How should the quantity of homocystin be reduced ?
For reducing the quantity of homocystin at first it is essential to bring change in your life - style and eating habits .
Scientists have found out that the homocystin may be controlled by increasing the quantity of vitamin B . . - 12 and folic acid in food .
These vitamins are generally found in colored vegetables and fruits .
B . is found in tandoori chicken , tandoori fish , wheat , whole pulses , cabbage and in arhar dal etc .
Vitamin B - 12 is found in toned milk , toned cheese , tandoori fish and the white part of egg .
Folic acid may be obtained from green leafy vegetables , masoor , urad , lobia , lettuce , winter lentils , peas , cauliflower , cow milk etc .
Apart from this Vitamin B - 12 can also be obtained from curd , carrot , tomato , mint , lady 's finger , brinjal and gram .

The humidity and temperature of this weather is helpful in the growth of organisms and insects .
This is the reason that in monsoon indigestion , allergy , dysentery , cough , cold , eye infections etc diseases occur .
On drinking polluted water also diseases occur in which typhoid , cholera , jaundice , amoebiasis are very common .
These days at every place there are heaps of garbage and the water also continues to get accumulated which is the suitable place for the breeding of mosquitoes , flies , cockroaches etc .
Many types of diseases start spreading through these .
From mosquitoes malaria , dengue etc spread .
The cockroaches pollute the food materials by reaching in the kitchen , due to these diseases of stomach happen .

Skin diseases also trouble a lot in rainy season ringworm , scabies , itching occur more in these days only .
The diseases occurring in rainy season .
Dysentery with blood - due to the consumption of polluted and contaminated water in rainy season and due to the weakness of stomach pain and spasm happen .
In order to remove this disease take poppy seed , dry ginger powder and candy sugar in equal quantity and make powder by breaking - grinding .
Take this mixture one spoon each at the interval of every 3 hours .
By consuming three - four times a day with one cup water which has been boiled and cooled mucus , dysentery with blood and spasm and pain in stomach get stopped .
Till the time of benefit do not consume fried things , heavy things , hot tea , hot milk and salty substances .
The immune power to bear those matter and environment are not there in the body , due to the effect of that matter or environment there is reaction in the body and it is called allergy .
In rainy season due to the allergy because of polluted environment and substances in some people breathing or respiratory diseases occur .
To avoid this complication equal quantity of mulhathi and fine powder of turmeric should be mixed and half spoon should be taken with warm water two three times in a day .
By this method one gets riddance from disease like cold , respiratory diseases , dry cough etc and immune power develops in the body .
Because of contamination of water in this season dysentery , vomiting appear separately or even together .
ANM bahanji had also said it that if the child faces difficulty in drinking mother 's milk or his breathing becomes fast then it would have to be taken to the hospital immediately .
Radha knows that there is complete nutrition in the milk of the mother .
Therefore for complete four months she fed Muniya with her own milk .
ORS , glucose or not even water , no matter how much hot or cold it had been .
In the initial days do not bathe the child only wipe with cloth .
Up to four months do not give anything other than mother 's milk .
Definitely take the weight of the child .
If the child has problem in drinking water or the breathing is fast then immediately take it to big hospital .
Exactly one and half months after birth Radha took Muniya to get the vaccine injected .
Behanji said that vaccine and doses save from six polio like diseases , therefore in getting the entire vaccine there should not be mistake .
Exactly after one month Muniya received vaccine and dose again .
And one month after it , the third time .
Every vaccine was registered in the mother - child protection card and every time behanji reminded Radha of coming the next time for the vaccines .
Behanji also told Radha that she should not forget at all the vaccine of diphtheria that would be put in the ninth month of Muniya .
Because of if the vaccine is not given to the child and if diphtheria occurs then after that diseases like dysentery , pneumonia , malnutrition and sarsaam etc .
But on the completion of ninth month Muniya got the vaccine of diphtheria and with it she also received the drops of vitamin A to save from night blindness .
She will continue getting the dose of vitamin A every six month up to three years .
This you should also remember that on the decided dates you must get the vaccine - dose given .
Every time get the protection card filled .
Do not forget the vaccine of diphtheria on the completion of ninth month .
Give the drops of vitamin A up to three years .
Radha had fed Muniya with her own milk from the first month her birth and up to four months she had not given her anything apart from her milk .
Every month Radha had to take the weight of Muniya .
On sixth month the weight of Muniya was twice from that at birth .
Radha became happy that the weight of Muniya had increased correctly according to the saying of A . . . behanji .
Then three - four times a day Radha started feeding Muniya half bowl of mashed chapatti , dal and vegetables .
And with it Radha also used to give green leafy vegetables , papaya and gourd so that night blindness does not occur to Muniya .
Now Muniya is of one year , today is her birthday .
Now her weight is three times of that at birth .
Every body at home are happy that nurturing of Muniya is happening in the correct manner .
Now Radha feeds Muniya half bowl of food even five - six times in a day .
You all should also remember that in six months the weight should be doubled .
To the child of four to twelve months half bowl of food must be fed three - four times a day .
The weight should be three times on the completion of one year .
From twelve to eighteen months feed half bowl food five - six times a day .
One day Muniya started getting loose motion .
Radha became worried , she remembered the saying of A . . . behanji that because of repeated dysentery the water of the body and the salts come out and there may even be danger to his life .
Immediately as per told by bahanji Radha started giving liquid items found in the house repeatedly to Muniya .
Like the water of dal , starch water of rice , lemonade or light tea .
But together with these things behanji had also asked to give O . . . but that there was no O . . . at home .
Sohan brought O . . . packet from anganwari .
Radha made O . . . solution according to the process told by A . . . bahanji .
And made Muniya drink after every dysentery .
Next day Radha threw the leftover solution and made fresh solution .
Apart from this she also continued feeding complete meal to Muniya .
In two - three days the dysentery stopped on its own and Muniya became alright .
Everyone should remember it always that as dysentery starts in child , keep giving domestic liquid things after every dysentery .
Deficiency of water in body is very dangerous , therefore keep giving O . . . solution as well .
At least give half bowl of food four - five times in a day certainly and even after this there is dysentery then take her to health center .
The treatment of cough - cold may be done even in the house .
Therefore on contracting cold Radha treated Muniya this way .
By making her drink tulsi tea , and mixing ginger juice and lemon juice in honey .
By giving more and more things to drink and by feeding regularly .
Muniya became alright in three - four days .
But Radha thought if her condition would have become worse even after doing everything .
Bahanji counselled that the meaning of such happening is pneumonia and there are three symptoms to recognize it stopping of food - drinks , fast breathing and rib movement .
In such situation take the child to bahanji immediately and get her administered the medicine of pneumonia .
If bahanji tells then immediately go to big hospital and get her checked up .
If due to any reason you do not find bahanji then also take the child to big hospital immediately .
Muniya did not even become of one year that mother - in - law started expressing the desire for a grandson .
Radha asked bahanji , she said that it will take two to three years for the weakness that has come in the body after the birth of Muniya to go away .
As such if there is pregnancy then there may be problem as well as complication and the prospective child may also stay weak .
Also Muniya will stop getting mother 's milk and her care will also not be taken .
Radha understood , the meaning of more and frequent children is disease in the destiny of child , malnutrition and twelve months of money crunch .
Bahanji told easy and reliable ways of contraception .
After discussion Sohan and Radha chose the right way and decided that for three years they would not produce second child .
You should also remember that there should be a gap of three years between two children .
Conception before three years is bad for the health of mother and child .
For keeping gap between two children use condom , pills or copper . .
On stopping the these methods second child may be given birth to .
One day some people did a counsel after coming to the village , Radha and Sohan also went , the discussion happened regarding the stopping of disease through hygiene .
After toilet putting soil or ash over it .
After washing the hands properly only feeding the child and using clean water .
To protect food from dirt and flies .
Burning the garbage of the household or burying it in the ground .
Not letting water accumulate near well or hand pump .
Through all these things the prevention of diseases may happen to a great extent .
Everybody liked the talks and with the help of institution and panchayat people completed these together .
Sohan and Radha in fact even swore to ward off dirt and disease .
After some days the result also came in front , as dirt lessened the diseases too started reducing .
Diabetes has taken the form of an epidemic in the world and its various kinds of social and financial adverse effects are also coming forward .
In the patients of diabetes diabetes foot is an extremely serious problem .
Do you know that in the world every year the foot of 10 lakh patients has to be amputated because of diabetes foot ?
Thus in the whole world in every 30 seconds surgery of amputating the foot of a certain patient afflicted with diabetes foot takes place .
My intention of telling you these figures is not to frighten you , but to caution you .
By researches done in this regard it has been proved that by good care it is possible to escape from the problem of diabetes foot to great extent .
Hence it is necessary that patients of diabetes should know this well what effect of this disease can occur on feet and how the care of feet should be taken .
The ancient proverb of Prevention is better than cure is absolutely successful in diabetes disease .
There is a chance of occurrence of ulcer in feet to the patients of diabetes due to the following two reasons .
In the patients of diabetes because of damage occurring in the nervous system there is decline in capability to feel in their feet and they do not feel pain at all due to which wound or injury in feet does not get detected in time .
In patients of diabetes because of flaccid blood circulation wounds or injuries heal late and on occurrence of a small wound danger of infection keeps lurking .
Such people whose blood level is high can suffer from diabetes foot .
Hence if you are ever told such that you have diabetes or there is a likelihood of occurrence of diabetes then you should definitely save your feet from getting hurt and you should also take proper care of them .
In patients of diabetes the likelihood of diabetes foot increases if you have diabetes neuropathy .
If blood circulation is flaccid in your feet .
If there is a deformity in your feet , like there is corn or hammer-toe in feet .
If you wear shoes of wrong shape or design .
If you are afflicted with uncontrolled blood sugar .
If you smoke beedi-cigarette , drink alcohol or your cholesterol level stays high .
If because of diabetes there has been ulcer in your feet ever before .
If because of diabetes you have disease of kidneys , heart or eyes .
The main causes of diabetes foot  ulcer and infection in feet  are .
Due to bite of wrong sized or new shoes .
Wounds in feet like wounds occurred unknowingly by shoe bite or by walking barefoot those which patient is unable to detect .
Blisters occurred by burning  like because of bath by extremely hot water , bottle of hot water , heat radiator , etc .  .
Infection of corn plaster and nails .
Wound occurred by continuously staying in bed of patient  bed blisters  .
Deformity in feet like kinak , clawed nail , corn , etc .
Care of diabetic patient and feet .
In preventing diabetes the role of the patient himself is most important .
Patients should examine their feet everyday on a regular basis .
Patients should look at the upper and lower parts of their feet attentively everyday .
Patients should also examine the parts between their fingers and parts near the ankle close to heel regularly .
Patients should keep in mind if there is no wound , cut or pain anywhere while examining their feet regularly .
If there is no crack or cut in the skin of feet of patient .
If the skin of feet of patient is not dry or soft .
If there is no swelling in one foot or leg of the patient .
If there is no formation of warts or kinak in feet of patients .
Change in the nails growing on the inner side of fingers like nails getting thick or colourless is a sign of diabetes foot .
Occurrence of blisters on skin is also a sign of diabetes foot .
Occurrence of hot  cold spots on skin is a sign of diabetes foot .
To prevent diabetes foot keep an eye on changes in blood circulation .
Keep an eye on color of fingers also .
By your sitting on chair etc . on hanging your legs if color of fingers of your feet starts becoming red , pink or purple then blood circulation in your feet is not right .
Do not be indifferent to pain in feet .
If at night or by walking little you start feeling pain in legs then understand that blood circulation in a certain vessel is blocked .
If there is a problem in your nails like hard nail then cut your nails carefully or get help from a professional .
Do not cut your nails quite deep rather cut straight .
If nails are left pointed then file them .
If you are troubled by corn or warts then never cut corn or warts yourself .
Do not use corn pad also because skin burns by this and can take form of an ulcer .
Safe cure for wart or kinak is only that you should consult a therapist .
Everyday in the morning and before sleeping wash your feet with lukewarm water and use a moderate soap .
Before washing your feet kindly ensure that water is not extremely hot .
Wipe your feet with a soft towel of a light color and wipe between your fingers carefully so that skin there does not get scraped by rubbing .
After wiping your feet examine your feet carefully if there are no signs of blood of pus on it .
If you find signs of blood or pus then consult a therapist quickly .
After wiping apply talcum powder between feet and fingers so that there remains no wetness .
If because of a certain reason you have to keep your feet in water then do not keep for more than 2-3 minutes because by being in water for a long time skin of feet becomes extremely soft .
Foot spa ' may prove harmful for patients of diabetes especially who have disease related to neuropathy or pulse .
If your feet are getting dry then apply a cream so that there are no cracks .
Do not apply cream between fingers .
If feet are too dry then use cream twice a day .
Make a selection of your cream only on consulting a therapist because for extremely dry feet special cream , containing urea , is available .
Be careful that inside the house pointed things like needle , insulin syringe or pin etc . do not remain lying on the floor .
Patients of diabetes should not walk barefoot .
By walking barefoot there surely stays a chance of getting injured rather extreme pressure is also exerted on feet due to absence of support from shoes .
Wear thick socks , and shoes should also be comfortable and of appropriate size .
Examine your shoes and socks from time to time and before wearing shake it from top to bottom so that if there is a pointed thing , etc . it should come out .
Be careful that feet do not come in direct contact with things like bar heater or bottle of hot water because skin may burn by it .
To keep skin warm wear thick socks .
Once a year definitely get your feet examined by specialists of foot care  podiatrist  .
Patients of diabetes should maintain special caution about shoes .
Often chance of occurrence of ulcer increases by wearing new shoes .
If you buy new shoes then first see them wearing in the house for 20-30 minutes .
If shoes bite some part of your foot or exert extreme pressure then get the cobbler to loosen the shoe a bit else buy new shoes .
Never stay wearing a new shoe for the whole day .
It will be better that you take the shoes to the podiatrist .
Do not wear open slippers or sandals and do not wear shoes without socks .
Wear leather or vinyl-mesh mix shoes .
Shoes should be broad and open so that feet fit in properly .
Shoes should be of round toes .
The part that supports the heel of the shoe should be tough so that it does not become flat .
Tie the leather straps properly or wear the shoes by means of Velcro so that feet stay in a comfortable position .
The sole of shoes should be flexible and about 1 cm thick .
The interior of the shoes should be soft .
While buying shoes putting hand in the shoes check if the interior of the shoes is not rough .
Buy new shoes after noon because feet swell during the day .
Often shoes bought in the morning do not fit in the evening .
Prior to buying shoes in the evening take a measure of your foot on a cardboard thereafter buy new shoes on the basis of its measure .
It is said that ' to delay is better than an accident ' but by delaying in case of diabetes foot an accident may occur .
Therefore from today rather from now itself start taking care of your feet in the right manner because the best cure for diabetes is its prevention only .
Even then if the symptoms of diabetes foot are visible to the patient of diabetes in his feet then without delaying consult your therapist immediately .
Diabetes has taken the shape of an epidemic in the world today .
In India the number of patients of diabetes is more than in all the countries in the world .
Today approximately 4 crore people are afflicted with diabetes in India and by 2030 there is a likelihood of this number reaching to 7 . crores .
The main cause of disease of diabetes is a comfortable lifestyle , obesity and excess in population of old people .
Therefore we get to see the number of patients of diabetes more in cities as compared to villages .
There is an estimate that 30 % patients living in metropolitan cities do not know that they have come into the clutches of diabetes disease .
Comparatively with the Southern countries Indians are becoming prey to diabetes in youth itself .
Because of which there is a great harm to the economy also .
Diabetes is of two types , Type-I and Type-II , but in India 95 % patients are of Type-II only and only 5 % patients are found to be of Type-I .
During the past years number of Type-II patients is increasing continuously .
In the condition before occurrence of diabetes  pre-diabetic  on examining blood on an empty stomach level of glucose increases and ' glucose tolerance ' becomes abnormal .
It is that condition when glucose in blood is more than normal but person can not be called a diabetes patient yet .
From ' pre-diabetic ' patients 5 - 10 % people come into category of diabetes each year .
This is a good news that prevention of diabetes is possible .
Along with change in lifestyle prevention of diabetes is possible by proper use of medicine .
Researches tell that healthy diet  less calorie , less fat-acidic and fiber in abundance  and through regular exercise  everyday 30 minutes and 5-7 times in a week  diabetes can be reduced by 50 % in people of abnormal glucose tolerance .
By giving medicines like metformin , acrabase and glitazones 30-60 % reduction can be brought in cases of diabetes in people of abnormal glucose tolerance .
In diabetes life threatening , large and minute complications can be born in the vessels .
To prevent these complications aid of heart vessel and pancreas transplant and laser photocoagulation can be taken .
Due to these chances of occurrence of blindness , disfigurement and premature death can be there .
Diabetes of pregnancy can prove to be harmful for mother and child both .
The complications of diabetes can be stopped from increasing .
It has been proven from both studies ` Diabetes control and complications trial '  in category-I diabetes  and United Kingdom Prospective  Category - II diabetes  that it is possible to prevent minute vessel complications by intensive glucose control nevertheless through intensive glucose control controlling large vessel complications is not that significant .
Through blood pressure control , intensive lipid management and anti-platelet therapy these complications can be reduced in a significant manner .
These complications can be stopped in a significant manner by keeping a strict control on all these abnormal processes and expense that is incurred on the patient is also less .
Cure of diabetes and related complications is expensive .
An expense of about Rs . 5000 can come every year on the treatment of a patient .
Cure can be more expensive if complications of patient increase else he has to be admitted to the hospital .
There is an expense of more than Rs . 20,000 crore on the therapy of Indian diabetes patients .
A strict control on the glucose level of diabetes patient is difficult because the danger of occurrence of hypoglycemia in them can increase by it .
By new medicines like insulin analog , inhaled insulin , peptide-I  exenatide  like glucagon , meglitinide derivative , DPP-IV inhibitors control of level of glucose can be done without the danger of hypoglycemia .
Despite of being acquainted with advantages of strict control on glucose , blood pressure control and lipid control only 30-40 % patients are able to have this control and out of these also only 10 % patients are able to have control over all of these .
It is necessary to spread information about researches that happen on diabetes and control related cures on a massive level .
If diabetes and its complications are not stopped from taking a dreadful form then in a developing country like India catastrophic circumstances can originate .
Here even today we can not control the pathologies and mortality rate due to infectious diseases and prenatal diseases .
For this we will have to bring changes in lifestyle of common man .
We will have to examine people who have more danger of occurrence of diabetes , we will have to take more care of pre-diabetic patients , we will have to control the glucose level and we will have to control the blood pressure and lipid of diabetic patients .
Although doing this is extremely difficult but it is necessary to achieve these goals .
Seeing the large number of patients of diabetes it will not be inappropriate to call India a diabetes capital .
Currently number of diabetes patients in India is about 370 lakh .
There is a chance of this number increasing to become about 860 lakh in 2030 .
There are a number of reasons behind cases of diabetes increasing suddenly in India .
Having congenital reasons , having much weight , imitation of western lifestyle , sensitivity , stomach fat and insulin resistance  with less weight  .
Diabetes can affect various body parts .
Nervous system , eyes , kidneys , bones , etc . also have not escaped this epidemic .
By diabetes disorders can occur in bones , joints and muscles and nerves .
Because of which stiffness in joints - swelling , ulcers in feet , decaying of feet else feet can become dark .
If proper control is not kept over diabetes then bone related diseases can occur .
If an elderly woman is afflicted with category . diabetes then danger of bone breaking increases by it .
If bone breaks then it takes a long time for it to join .
In addition to this bones become basically weak because due to deficiency in insulin developmental process of bones stops .
This does not happen in category - II diabetes afflicted as most of the patients of this category are fat as a result of which their bones are also big and strong .
Hence patients of category . require an average of 1200 mg Calcium and 400 to 600 units ' vitamin . ' everyday .
Dose of osteoporosis is necessary for patients of category -1 like common patients .
According to an interesting research if baby is given ' vitamin . ' then danger of occurrence of category . diabetes reduces .
There is more chance of occurrence of infection to patients of diabetes .
Various deformities and mortality rate can increase in patients due to infection .
There can be various reasons for its basis .
Immunity reducing , nerves of body or nervous system getting affected negatively , glucose level increasing in skin .
The level of amount of glucose in skin exceeding 150 , danger of bone infection increases .
Hence controlled amount of glucose is necessary in surgeries related to bones like joint transplant and treatments like joining or setting a broken bone .
If level of glycosylated hemoglobin increases by 2 % then by that danger of occurrence of abscess or ulcer increases by 1 . % and danger of amputating a body part increases by 1 . % .
Here it is reasonable to discuss the topic of diabetes and infection of feet because it is found so in most cases .
Due to the reason that sensory nerves get damaged , the feeling of hot and cold and injury in feet gets reduced and feet get continually damaged .
By damage of nerves that are manager of muscles there can be paralysis in feet , feet can become deformed or twisted .
By exertion of more pressure on less space chance of formation of ulcer increases .
In this manner by damage of nerves that control the temperature of skin , skin gets worse .
Because of blockage in the blood circulation of feet proper nutrition is unable to reach the feet and less white blood cells reach there .
Some white cells that reach get damaged because of diabetes since these cells save the body from infection .
Hence immunity becomes less .
Bone diseases occurring due to diabetes are in this manner .
Weakening of bones , change coming in the walk ,  balance of body is not maintained by blockage of nerves  occurrence of decrease in immunity , wound not filling up fast , getting an infection again and again from wound not healing and consequently from these diseases starting from handicap of patient even death can occur .
Because of diabetes infection of feet begins from the soles of feet .
In the beginning there is a redness in skin which remains even after pressing .
Skin gets tough .
There can be formation of ulcer by injury in foot that reaches the muscles and bones and pus can develop in foot , fingers can degenerate or darken .
You should cure patient immediately , surgery and amputation of foot are also combined in the treatment .
Infection of foot because of diabetes is a state of emergency .
It is necessary to do the amputation of foot in 80 % of the cases and treatment of patient on admitting in hospital in 20 % of the cases .
In Indian patients cause of 12 % cases of ulcer in feet is diabetes .
There is influence on joints because of diabetes .
Disease named ` Charcot joint ` can occur to 1 out of 600 patients of patients afflicted with diabetes .
The difference between infection and Charcot is this that in Charcot feet of patients are red , swollen , and twisted and patient does not have any pain in it and patient does not have fever .
A specific kind of test might be necessary to detect ` Charcot joint ` .
Aid of diabetes control  glucose control in blood  , plaster of a specific shape , shoes and surgery can be taken in the treatment .
Because of diabetes bones become weak and so they can break soon .
Specific caution is required during treatment because there remains a chance of the body part degenerating in the plaster .
Danger of infection during surgery can also increase because of diabetes .
It takes time for the bone to join in diabetes .
As a result of the bone breaking often deformity can occur in joints also .
Flexibility of joints ends by accumulation of glucose in joints , with this deformity can arise in skin of joints and bone fibers , consequently stiffness can occur in joints .
Skin of hands of patients of diabetes becomes thick , stiff like wax and dried up .
Fingers of hands stiffen and snap on bending .
This is also called ' trigger finger ' .
The whole hand on some patients gets twisted then distortion comes in forefinger of some patients which is known by the name of ' dupuytren ' .
Because of these difficulties patients can not even perform the action of namaskar properly .
Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in nerves and hands and surgery is taken for treatment .
Normally shoulders of both arms get jammed else stiffness occurs in them because of which patients can not even comb their hair .
Patients become unsuccessful in rotating their arms behind their waist or above .
It takes a long time for such patients to recover .
Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in joints , telescope or general surgery is taken for treatment .
Nerves get deformed due to diabetes .
Blockage occurs in blood circulation in vessels by excess of glucose in blood and other defects can also arise in vessels because of which most patients lose balance related control of sense and body .
Many problems like shock in hands and feet , feeling a burning sensation , in hands and feet going numb , occurrence of paralysis and fingers getting distorted can originate .
Defect can also arise in the muscles of feet and patient is unable to walk properly .
Occurrence of problem like compression of nerve by thickening and stiffening of skin near and inside joints and by blood circulation not occurring normally is a common symptom .
Mostly nerves of wrists can compress , by compression of medial nerve of wrist ' carpal tunnel syndrome ' occurs .
In this pain , shock and numbness which usually increases at night time occur in thumb and with it in two and a half fingers .
This difficulty can also happen to patients of diabetes by working on the computer in a wrong position or working much , holding the newspaper , etc. .
This problem occurs more in patients of diabetes in those doing work related to much bending and rotating of wrist .
The treatment of every problem in diabetes starts with control of glucose in blood through medicines .
Hence control on amount of glucose is vital to prevent adverse effects on nerves because of diabetes .
In addition to this treatment is done by pain killers , vitamins , pancreas transplant .
Main cause of disease of kidneys is a diabetes generated disease .
In their lifetime about 40 % diabetes patients get afflicted with disease of kidneys .
Disease of kidneys occurring due to diabetes is called nephropathy .
This disease is detected in diabetes patients when protein products in urine are found to be 500 mg on running a urine test .
In comparison to white people the chance of occurrence of diabetes generated kidney disease in Asian Indians is 40 times more .
On initial level kidney disease in diabetes patients is detected via a special test when the level of their albumin is found abnormal   30 mg  per day  .
This level is called insipient diabetic nephropathy .
The danger of kidney and heart disease to such patients is more .
This disease can be stopped via initial diagnosis and proper treatment of disease .
The following are the causes of diabetes generated kidney disease .
Having disease of diabetes for a long time .
Not having a proper control on blood glucose .
High blood pressure , heredity , race , smoking etc . can also be causes of diabetes generated kidney disease .
Diabetes generated kidney disease occurs because of protein urea  on increase in amount of protein in urine  and glomerular filtration rate  G . . .  .
The main cause of diabetes generated kidney disease is uncontrolled level of blood glucose in body .
However imbalance of blood glucose in body is harmful for cells and other body parts which can become a cause of various kinds of ailments .
Hence it is possible to prevent diabetes generated kidney disease to quite an extent keeping level of blood glucose controlled in diabetes patients and diagnosing the disease on the preliminary level and detecting microalbumin urea in the urine .
Urine of 24 hours is tested to detect microalbumin urea .
This is the most reliable test for detecting microalbumin urea .
For the diagnosis of insipient diabetic nephropathy ratio of albumin and retaining is detected in urine .
It is also possible to do this test by a recent sample of urine .
Preliminary prevention is having control on blood glucose .
The normal level of HbA1C blood glucose is Up to 7 % .
Chances of other complications arising because of diabetes remain less till this level but on HbA1c being more than 7 % all relative efforts should be made to control blood glucose .
By a reduction of 1 %  about 32 mg of blood glucose per day  in HbA1C there is a reduction of 38 % in diabetic retinopathy and 22 % to 38 % in diabetic nephropathy .
Therefore diabetes patient can prevent other disease occurring from this disease by keeping proper control on blood glucose .
Diabetes patients should keep blood pressure less than 125  75 .
Reducing blood pressure from 85 to 81 means reducing diabetes generated kidney disease by 55 % .
It remains quite useful to give medicines like Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for keeping level of blood pressure maintained normal .
It is important for prevention of kidney disease that you reduce the amount of protein going in the urine of patient , you maintain proper control on blood glucose and blood pressure .
Take appropriate therapy for anemia , lipid ailment and treat it taking antibiotic medicines or injections of insulin on much increase in amount of glucose .
Conclusively you can say that diabetes generated kidney disease is the main cause of kidney failure .
Hence diabetes patients should keep doing their regular check-up so that preliminary diagnosis of the diabetes generated kidney disease is possible and through relative treatment the disease is stopped from advancing .
Condition of ailments related to metabolism of glucose , fats and proteins in body or complete deficiency of insulin is called diabetes .
In both there is adverse effect on processes of various body parts like metabolism nervous system by defect in insulin and increase in glucose level and immunity system and skin also gets affected by it .
In most of the diabetes afflicted patients changes related to skin are seen .
However in most of the cases causes of changes that occur in skin remain unknown .
Because of occurrence of defect in vessels , nerves or because of decrease in immunity in body due to excess of glucose and imbalanced level of insulin skin related disease occur in diabetes patients .
Because of diabetes such substances get accumulated below skin and inside skin by which skin becomes thick and tough .
Normally such a situation arises at that time when residual substances do not get out of skin through sweat .
Because of diabetes activities of joints become limited .
In some patients due to accumulation of proteins in the fingers of hands and feet there is inconvenience in trying to move them and their efficiency is affected badly .
Various types of wounds and injuries occur in feet and legs on increase in level of glucose in blood or not consuming the medicines properly .
Because of these wounds and injuries a specific kind of fluid gets stored in the arteries .
In some cases blood circulation can lessen or stop in the skin of body .
Because of diabetes deep wounds that are non-healing occur .
Efficiency of nervous system gets adversely affected by excess of glucose in arteries that convey blood to the nervous system .
As a result of which that organ or part of body goes numb and injury in numbed parts can not be detected and the danger of occurrence of infection in the wound is retained .
Excess of glucose makes the immune system of the body also atrophic .
By which microbes  germs admitted in the body do not terminate because of which body becomes prey to any kind of infection soon .
Some of the main microbes of these are in this manner : Streptococcus , Staphylococcus . . Coli . . tuberculosis virus , Herpes Zoster , Herpes Simplex , Fungi , Candida , Micromyosis , Dermatofitosis , etc .
Occurrence of rashes and boils in body because of diabetes is a common problem .
In addition to this fatal diseases like necrotizing fasciitis and cellulites carbuncle can also occur .
Blood related disease named mucormycosis can occur because of diabetes .
Amount of fat in body increases due to diabetes .
Amount of glucose increases because of a specific enzyme by which efficiency of body reduces or ends .
Red and yellow rashes develop on skin .
Though these rashes can be in any part of the body but generally they are more near the joints .
Rashes named ' jennthomas ' develop by amount of cholesterol or triglycerides increasing in blood .
Certain part of skin of body becomes dark and thick because of abnormality of diabetes .
Sometimes disease named ' acanthosis nigricans ' can also occur .
In addition to this following diseases are also seen because of diabetes , like - malignant otitis media , rhinocerebral mucormycosis , pseudomonas infection , bullosis diabeticorum , necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum , etc .
Caution to prevent adverse effects of diabetes .
Keep doing physical exercise .
Have meals on time .
Meals should be clean and nutritious , in which all required elements are combined .
Take medicines on time and on a regular basis .
By these cautions you can keep yourself safe from the adverse effects of diabetes .
In only 15 % of patients of diabetes symptoms of nerve diseases are seen , whereas in up to 50 % patients muscle deformities and nerve related defects are found .
Symptoms of nerve diseases are found most in patients of 50 years of age and above , lesser in those below 30 years of age and in about negligible amount in patients in childhood .
Because of diabetes many forms of nerve related diseases are found .
In diabetes ophthalmoplegia there are eye related complications .
In serious mononeuropathy outburst of disease is seen in form of muscle deformity of muscles of arms and body .
Mononeuropathy disease advances fast .
There is acute pain in mononeuropathy disease .
Neuropathy disease affects the main organs in an unequal way .
In mononeuropathy disease main muscles become weak and their weight decreases .
In mononeuropathy disease there is no pain in muscles , there is lack of consciousness .
During mononeuropathy disease sometimes the disease seems to be increasing then sometimes it appears to be decreasing .
Remote like preliminary sensory polyneuropathy affects feet and legs instead of hands .
Polyneuropathy advancing gradually takes the form of a serious disease .
In self conducted nerve defect generally bladder and blood circulatory system are affected more .
Abdominal nerve defect and radiculopathy generally occur together .
Particularly remote sensory nerve defect and abdominal nerve defect occur together .
Hyperglycemia , that is , level of glucose in blood increases which takes nerves into its clutches .
It has recently been seen in researches that with the aid of medicines the effect that it has on hyperglycaemic nerves can be influenced through a right balance between impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral neuropathy .
Innumerable changes in relation to pathology are being seen in both myelinated and unmyelinated kinds of fibers .
The main causes of peripheral neuropathy are not fully known now .
According to metabolic theory amount of glucose inside cells that completely surround the glycolytic pathway increases .
According to vascular theory due to increase of endoneurial vascular resistance of hyperglycaemic blood endoneurial ischemia increases .
According to altered neurotrophic sport theory neuropathic factors play the main role for maintenance , development and repair of nervous system .
According to laminin theory the formation of laminin beta . in less than the normal amount plays the main role in diabetic neuropathy defect .
According to auto immune theory demyelination is found in cranial and peripheral nerves .
The third and sixth nerve of brain may get affected by infection of head and back bone in serious mononeuropathy diabetes and it takes a long time for it to heal .
The problem of multiple mononeuropathy and radiculopathy mostly affects the elderly patients of diabetes .
In multiple mononeuropathy there is pain in the same way in many nerves .
Multiple mononeuropathy and radiculopathy can occur in relatively less diabetes also .
Weakness and undernourishment can occur in pelvic girdle and muscles close to it but effect can be seen on remote muscles also .
In this disease the upper body parts get affected very less .
Symptoms of remote polyneuropathy diabetes are mostly like normal diabetes neuropathy .
Symptoms of remote polyneuropathy are numbness , shock and continuous pain .
Normally in this disease right symptoms are found in legs , feet and toes mostly at night time .
The clinical depiction of it is such that deep intensive decline , contractions of bladder and atrophy in hands - feet arises .
Efficiency of pupil of eye and tear glands can end by autonomic neuropathy .
You do not sweat in autonomic neuropathy , blood circulation gets affected .
Digestive system gets affected by autonomic neuropathy .
Flaccidity occurs in gastrointestinal system , bladder and genitals by autonomic neuropathy .
Blood pressure can also fall by autonomic neuropathy .
C . . . protein becomes 50 to 150 mg per cm or exceeds this too in every kind of diabetes neuropathy .
Autonomic neuropathy disease occurs on the basis of spinal nerves and ganglions getting affected .
Mostly damage by it is found in myelinated nerve fiber .
Demyelination and remyelination can also be seen in the remaining fibers of axon .
N . . and E . . . are special accessories in the diagnosis research .
Regular examination of level of blood glucose is extremely necessary .
There is only one goal of treatment that the level of blood glucose remains normal and controlled because it is connected with the damage of nerves .
In autonomic neuropathy through treatment by medicines like aldose inhibitor and albesterine weakness of patient may go .
Shock reduces and there is relief from pain by use of these medicines .
There is a recent mention of ordinary component like gangliosides in neuronal membrane literature but you get relief by it only to an extent .
The patients who have retained problems like numbness and shock in hands - feet for a long time you can give them amitriptyline medicine or anti distress like neuro generation .
Benefit also occurs by use of fluoxetine or sertraline .
You can stop fluctuations of unbearable pain by carbamazepine and fenitoina or gabapentin or pregabalin .
But normally results of these medicines are not satisfactory .
But sometimes better results are seen by neurontin .
Nerve block and epidural injections are beneficial for some patients .
There is pain for some duration in proximal , asymmetrical or ophthalmologic neuropathy which can be controlled by analgesic like diclofen , acetaminophen or tramadol .
The future of patients of remote preliminary sensory neuropathy is uncertain .
But many times it may take months or even years in other improvements and getting a relief to some extent .
Hence remember that on falling in the clutches of diabetes your life can become crippled because it can damage your nervous system also .
Therefore always consume healthy , balanced and nutritious diet by which control remains maintained on your blood glucose .
Exercise and yoga also prove to be very advantageous .
It is possible to stop long term complications of diabetes keeping control on the level of glucose in blood .
In the beginning you can have control on sugar in diabetes disease through pills .
But gradually pills stop showing effect .
To keep proper control on sugar it becomes important to take insulin .
If your doctor directs insulin then definitely take it .
Nearly 3 . crore people in our country are afflicted with diabetes and there is a chance of its increasing to 5 . 72 crore by 2025 .
World Health Organisation has called India to be the capital of diabetes .
Other than the family history sometimes some people do not have any specific problem or complaint and it is found only after testing that they are prey of this disease .
The women who have blood related disease of diabetes or are themselves diabetic should plan their family only after controlling this disease fully before conceiving taking advice of doctor and doing tests .
Sometimes patients are kept on pills for this disease .
You may need to get insulin injections stopping the pills on advice of doctor .
If this disease is for a long duration then you may need to test eyes , kidneys , heart and nervous system .
During the first three months of pregnancy if blood glucose is not controlled properly then chance of occurrence of congenital defect in child is a lot more .
If such a situation arises after pregnancy then weight of child in the womb may be above 4 kg and he may die in the womb .
Because of hormones that come out of the umbilical cord during pregnancy and pancreatic insulin that forms specially in body of women and the change in its use in the body some women get diabetes during pregnancy .
This diabetes is known by the name of gestational diabetes .
Whether a pregnant woman in normal conditions has diabetes or not , for this she is tested through GCT  Glucose Challenge Test  during 24 - 26 weeks of pregnancy .
For the test the woman doest not have to eat anything for two hours after her breakfast and after that she has to drink 50 grammes glucose .
One hour after drinking glucose she has to give her blood sample .
If it is more than 130 mg then there is a chance of G . . .
Then the woman is required to do GTT  Glucose Tolerance Test  that is of 100 grammes glucose .
Any two or more readings being more than normal the woman is considered afflicted with diabetes .
Such women who have pregnancy along with diabetes  G . . .  should be under special care of an obstetrician and gynaecologist .
Some special tests should be run on pregnant women .
You should do foetal echo or ultrasound level - II for foetus .
By which the child being healthy can be detected to quite a limit .
In the last 4 . weeks of pregnancy woman should keep note of turns by the foetus  kick count  .
In which the woman has to note the turning of child lying down for an hour in the morning , an hour during daytime and an hour at night .
During these three hours child should turn ten or more times .
In addition to this health of child can be detected to quite an extent by C . . . or through ultrasound  non stress test  .
Besides these it is important to run all tests on a diabetes afflicted pregnant woman that are told to an ordinary pregnant woman .
She should take note of the following things just as she finds out that she has a complaint of diabetes .
Take the right and nutritious diet .
Keep complete details of weight increase during pregnancy  10 - 12 kg  .
Do regular tests of blood glucose .
Take the correct and regular treatment .
Deliver in hospital on time .
Diabetes also means calorie control along with moderation from sugar , rice , potato , sweets or fruits .
Woman with normal weight should take 30 calories  kg according to her weight and woman with much weight should take 25 calories  kg .
The gist is this that she can take 1800 to 2500 calories of food in 24 hours .
She should make use of 50 - 55 % carbohydrates , 15 - 20 % proteins and remaining fats .
Out of this you should take 15 % in breakfast , 25 % in lunch , 30 % at night and the remaining calories in snacks .
You can take 10 % amount of the total energy every time in the morning , afternoon and before bed .
Normally during pregnancy weight of a woman with normal weight increases by 10 - 12 kg and weight of a woman with much weight by 7 . kg .
A pregnant woman afflicted with diabetes should  after meals  walk daily 2 . times for 20 - 30 minutes .
A woman afflicted with diabetes should soon learn to test her blood glucose and to apply injections of insulin .
You run test of sugar monitoring 7 times a day .
Before breakfast , before lunch , two hours after meals and one at 3 in the morning .
In the beginning you test everyday and later once or twice a week .
You can detect the state of last 2 - 12 weeks of blood glucose by tests of fructosamine and HbA1C .
When condition of application of insulin arrives patient should be admit in hospital and should keep glucose powder or biscuit with himself .
If blood glucose comes down a lot which is called hypoglycemia then immediately take sugar , glucose or biscuit .
There can be complaint of weakness , agitation , dizziness , sweating and fumbling with words .
Amount of insulin is increased or decreased from time to time by advice of doctor .
You can also give injections of insulin later yourself or with help from a relative at home according to advice of doctor .
You can also do sugar monitoring  empty stomach . hours after lunch 2 hours after dinner .  .
You wait for childbirth for 40 whole weeks in cases in which glucose control is good in them .
If disease of diabetes is detected late or is uncontrolled then in such a condition in pregnancy of 37 - 38 weeks you deliver artificially through medicines .
During labor you do blood glucose test of these patients quickly and glucose and insulin is given from time to time .
In many women because of large size of children , pain or high blood pressure childbirth happens by surgery .
In the beginning you give 1  V glucose to child later mother should breast feed the child again and again in 1 . hours .
Gradually you can increase it to 4 hours .
Complaint of diabetes during pregnancy becomes alright after childbirth also but it hints at future danger of diabetes to the woman .
This happens to nearly 50 % women in about 10 to 15 years .
This time can be increased by moderation in food , control on weight and regular exercise .
D . . can occur soon or in severity in the next pregnancy .
Hence before conception and in the beginning of pregnancy you should test blood glucose .
Miscarriage , congenital defects in children especially diseases of bones and heart can occur in uncontrolled diabetes .
In pregnant women according to duration and seriousness of diabetes dangerous difficulties like eye disease , heart disease , kidney disease , high blood pressure along with stroke can occur .
By infection a lot of difficulties can occur in treatment of pregnant woman with diabetes .
You can lead a simple and good life by taking care of yourself and following advice of doctor .
The use of appropriate device for family planning is wisdom .
You can take O . . . contraceptive pills easily . You can take only progesterone or contraceptive pills with it both .
It is necessary to test glucose amount in blood from time to time .
If diabetes is properly controlled by pills and insulin then you can do laparoscopic sterilisation to keep family restricted .
It is absolutely necessary to beware and cautious of diabetes for health .
Certain difficulties like obesity , high blood pressure , cancer of genitals , etc increase danger of diabetes with aging .
There is a saying that prevention is better than cure then be careful when there is time .
Make less use of sugar and sweets , do not let weight increase , do exercise and yoga .
Disease of diabetes can occur in a new born baby also .
Disease of diabetes that is found in small children is known in the form of D . . Type . in the medical world the meaning of which is deficiency of insulin or dependence on insulin .
In this deficiency of those cells occurs in pancreas gland that make insulin .
According to a survey the number of diabetes afflicted children is different in various races , countries .
On the basis of a survey where you find number of new cases in Karachi  Pakistan  to be 9 per lakh there in Finland you find it to be 40 per lakh and here this number increases per year .
In America in about a 1000 children 2 children are afflicted with diabetes .
But the main cause is genetic in which defect can occur in many genes and you do its classification on that basis itself .
In addition to this other causes present in environment infection , chemicals , geographical causes and food etc are main .
Rubella virus is main in infection .
To detect the chances of this disease we have to take the aid of genetic antibodies and metabolic markers .
The foremost genetic locus is H . . . Class - II .
Yes , disease of type . diabetes can occur in the week before birth itself and it cures on it own after staying for a few weeks or months .
You get to see disease of type . diabetes mainly in those children whose weight is less .
You see the same symptoms , that is , symptoms of urination and deficiency of water in these children also .
The treatment of these is also less sugar and insulin .
You see the irregularity of chromosome . in it .
But disease of diabetes that is found in some children can stay for life .
Amount of insulin that pancreas produces getting imbalanced is its main cause .
Disease of diabetes . . . II , that occurs in older children , that is , in the age of 15 - 16 years is like disease of diabetes occurring in adults only and its treatment is also possible with medicines like the disease of adults .
Disease of diabetes is mainly found in their parents also and its treatment also depends on pills .
It is also necessary to keep control on food , etc .
If there is not enough insulin in the body or there is some kind of a defect in insulin then glucose is unable to enter the stores of body and keeps getting accumulated in quite an amount in the blood circulation .
This condition is called diabetes .
Diabetes is a very unmanageable and difficult disease .
In this disease patient can keep himself healthy paying enough attention to food and his lifestyle .
Medicines work in diabetes disease only when diet of the patient is suitable .
Diabetes occurs because of heredity , obesity , being seated all the time , defect of liver , etc .
Diabetes patient feels very thirsty and also very hungry .
There is an urge to urinate again and again but urine comes out in small amount every time .
The disease resistance capacity of diabetes patient reduces .
Because of diabetes boils - rashes , itching , herpes , etc diseases begin .
Diabetes patient can have high blood pressure and heart disease .
There are many easy ways of keeping amount of glucose balanced in diabetes .
Bitter gourd is as beneficial as ambrosia in diabetes .
With use of bitter gourd glucose reduces quite a lot in blood .
By consumption of water of fenugreek seeds regularly for two months patients of diabetes get special a benefit .
Indian blackberry also proves to be efficient in diabetes disease .
Patient of diabetes gets special benefit by bringing in use 5 - 10 Indian blackberries everyday .
You should also include bottle gourd , cucumber , gherkin , tomatoes , Indian gooseberry , green leafy vegetables in your diet .
Consuming porridge is best in diabetes disease .
Afflicted with obesity and heart patients can also consume this porridge .
You should also use buttermilk in your diet regularly .
You can bridle diabetes by having regular meals , doing exercise , yogasana and having a stroll .
Diabetes is such a metabolism related disease that affects various parts of body .
Because of this disease mainly blood arteries and nerves get affected .
When a damage occurs in arteries and nerves of retina of eye because of diabetes then that condition is called diabetes retina damage .
In this defect fine cracks develop in surfaces of delicate blood arteries of the retina of eye because of which blood fluid starts leaking out .
This fluid produces swelling on the retina of eye because of which there is production of eye defect .
This eye defect can occur in various ways like - reduction in vision , finding difficulty in identifying colors , distorted appearance of shape .
There is adverse effect on retina of eye because of diabetic retinopathy which is of two types .
non - proliferative diabetic retinopathy .
In this condition because of walls of fine vessels of retina becoming weak they become extended in an irregular manner like a thin balloon .
It bursts due to weakening of walls because of which blood inside the fine vessels comes out and starts leaking on the retina .
Blood leaking on the retina itself can become the cause of blindness .
In this manner fluid of blood can also leak from weak walls of vessels which can later take form of a tough clot .
If this secretion gets accumulated on the pupil then it can become the cause of blindness .
Circulation of fluid stops because of the adverse effect on sensitive vessels of retina of eyes in diabetes .
There is destruction of elements of these nerves and they appear as flimsy bunches .
That very part of retina becomes inactive in which bunches of this kind form .
Because of less blood circulation in retina of eye in non - proliferative diabetic retinopathy a certain augmentation element starts forming because of which creation of new sensitive blood vessels starts .
These vessels burst due to weakening and there is coagulation of blood on retina .
There is huge deceleration on vision by this .
The chance of defect of retina of eye remains in patients of diabetes .
After about 10 years of diagnosis of diabetes in patients afflicted with diabetes defect of retina of eye can occur in about 80 % of these patients .
Normally it reaches 90 % after 25 years .
The more diabetes remains controlled the more is the chance of diabetic retinopathy delayed .
If the eye specialist feels that patient has caught disease in retina then he runs a test on him which we call fluorescein angiography .
In which a dye is inserted in the nerves via needle and a photograph of retinas of eyes is taken .
By this it is known till where the disease has progressed .
Thereafter you treat the patient according to the stage of progress of disease and if it is necessary then you treat the afflicted part by heating it via laser .
Nowadays there is production of such medicines also through which it is possible to treat applying needle to eye .
To escape from this disease keep diabetes in control .
Test your eyes on a regular basis .
On occurrence of complaints like blurring in vision , sudden reduction of vision , appearance of black spots in front of eyes , etc . consult your eye specialist without delay .
Once loss of eyesight occurs because of occurrence of damage to eye retina you can not bring it back .
It is possible to prevent occurrence of damage of retina in future by doing right treatment .
In disease of diabetes amount of glucose in blood increases .
Diabetes disease is a serious disease on which if you do not get control in time then it can also prove to be fatal .
Production of insulin in our body occurs through pancreas and insulin controls the amount of glucose .
Amount of glucose in blood increases by deficiency of insulin and patient gets afflicted with diabetes disease .
The main symptoms of diabetes disease are - feeling thirsty , blurring of vision , constant urge to urinate , failure in sexual activities , and numbness of hands and feet .
Excessive increase in amount of glucose in blood is the main cause behind all these , it is called hyperglycemia .
When amount of glucose reduces a lot in blood then it is called hypoglycemia .
This condition of hypoglycemia can prove to be very harmful .
The main causes of this condition can be excess amount of medicines , taking less amount of food , excessive exercising .
Uncontrolled diabetes is the birth giver  mother of many long term complications .
Damage to nervous system by which adverse effect on nerves like numbness of hands and feet , burning sensation else pain is a common thing which starting from the tip of fingers can slowly go upwards .
In this way joints and the soft ligaments near them get affected in diabetes orthopathy .
Normally first of all joints of shoulders get affected .
Pain first starts in shoulders then its effect is seen on activities of shoulders .
Patient starts feeling inconvenience in his daily activities like changing clothes , combing hair , etc. .
Physiotherapy can prove extremely beneficial for these complications related to diabetes disease .
The main aim of physiotherapy in complications related to neuropathy and orthopathy is especially pain relief and reducing swelling .
Other than this the goal of physiotherapy is that of prevention of joints getting twisted , restoring twisted joints to their old condition , making joints flexible and strong .
Other than this physiotherapy proves helpful in making patients dispose of their daily activities smoothly and systematically .
Infrared rays , shortwave diathermy , laser therapy , interferential therapy , ultrasonic rays , cold and hot packs , etc . methods are used in diabetes for pain relief .
Other than this some specific exercises also prove beneficial in pain relief and making joints active .
Diabetes also affects adversely the kidneys , eyes , heart and blood vessels and because of this there can be occurrence of problems like stroke , paralysis and obstruction in blood circulation .
The chance of occurrence of such diseases in patients of diabetes is many times more .
In the rehabilitation of such patients the role of physiotherapy remains significant .
Through the method of physiotherapy using certain specific techniques of exercise you make patient capable of leading a normal life .
These techniques take the aid of splintage and walking aids .
There can be infections of mouth , gums , lungs , skin , hands , feet , kidneys , urinary bladder and genitals of diabetes patient .
The infections occurring in patients of diabetes take longer to heal as compared to infections in the normal patients .
In physiotherapy department they make use of techniques like diapulse therapy or pulsar shortwave diathermy , ultraviolet for the treatment of injuries like ulcers of patients and bed sores of diabetes patients .
A certain technique of exercise is told by which there is appropriate maintenance of speed of blood circulation and patient gets relief .
If diabetes is kept in control then it is possible to prevent the adverse effects on other parts of body and diabetes patient can take pleasure of normal life .
It is necessary that these four pillars be followed arduously - food intake and nutrition , physical activities and exercise , regular examination of blood glucose , consumption of medicines according as instructed by physician .
Today diabetes is spread in the whole world on a large level .
Diabetes has emerged in the form of a universally accepted disease .
One out of every eight individuals in India is afflicted with diabetes .
Diabetes is actually a disease related to metabolism of carbohydrates .
On digestion of carbohydrate sugar reaches the liver in the form of glucose being absorbed by blood .
In the liver it depends on a hormone called insulin converted to glycogen which assists in the oxidation of glucose .
Insulin is that which stores glucose converting it to glycogen .
On occurrence of deficiency of insulin a hindrance is produced in metabolism .
As a result glucose does not get converted to glycogen due to which there is increase in level of glucose in blood and glucose starts getting expelled through urine .
Nowadays a variety of treatments and methods are available in the field of cosmetic science one of them is aroma therapy .
Aroma meaning fragrance and therapy meaning treatment , that is , treatment through fragrance .
Aroma therapy is a method the prevalence of which has increased a lot nowadays .
Aroma therapy is proving to be quite effective in health related diseases other than brightening up and gracing the beauty of skin .
What is aroma therapy ?
According to the popular beauty specialist Dr . Blossom Kochar , one using this therapy for more than 25 years , essence is extracted from things obtained from plants and trees , leaves , roots , bark , fruits and flowers , vegetables , spices , etc . which is called essential oil .
The speciality of essential oil is that it is extremely strong .
In essential oils there is no mixture of chemical elements .
From a ton of rose leaves only 1 litre essential oil is obtained which is equivalent to 25 grammes of herbal cream .
These oils are the complete life force of plants and trees , whereas only herbs are used in the herbal process .
These essential oils are anti - bacterial , antiseptic , antiviral , antifungal , anti - inflammatory , anti - rheumatic , anti - neurologic , anti - toxic , anti - depressant and deoderising .
Essential oil is beneficial in treatment .
Blossom Kochar says that treatment through these essential oils is a very pure process .
But before treatment it is very important to know how oils prove effective for us .
Aroma oils get benefit for us in three ways .
First - Under influence of their fragrance our mind immediately becomes stimulated .
Second - Reaching the inner layer of our skin through massage it heals it .
Third - They affect our mood .
These essential oils are used for the treatment of many types of problems .
Essential oil is used for many other problems that are skin related , hair related , mind  heart related and related to women .
Other than this some essential oils are used in food .
Essential oils prove effective for skin related problems like acne , occurrence of wrinkles , skin with spots and blemishes , infection of skin , sunburn , dark circles all around eyes , etc .
The requirement is of knowing the problem properly and treating it right .
Dr . Kochar says that for the treatment of skin essential oil is not applied on that spot from outside .
If there is formation of dark circles all around your eyes then to treat with this process it is very important to know as to why there is such formation .
After this beauty specialist treats with that process in which the person is given lavender essential oil for inducing sleep .
Mind and body both relax by patting on body a few drops of it mixed in water .
Then in the treatment process of dark circles a bit of shredded radish and pumpkin is soaked in a little warm milk .
Now they ask you to apply on dark circles straining them and mixing a drop of essential oil in them .
They ask you to apply aroma magic eye gel once a week .
Unless your mind is at peace , unless you feel sleepy , dark circles will not go away just by outer treatment .
Similarly if there is an acne problem then it has been seen for certain that they are found only in oily skin .
Hence they use such essential oils which has the quality of removing grease .
Put a few drops of essential oil in rose water and use camphor oil for cleaning face .
Other than this they ask you to take complete care of diet like avoiding consuming spicy , fried things , keeping stomach clean .
Through essential oils treatment of big problems related to skin also occurs properly like cellulite .

Hyper pigmentation are those spots of a dark color on face and other parts of body which reduce the attraction of skin .
Skin related problem of hyper pigmentation can happen to man or woman anyone .
Women have to face this problem more due to their delicate skin .
This problem is seen more during summer because sunlight is stronger during these days .
Ultraviolet rays of Sun burn the skin because of which spots and blemishes occur on it .
In relation to this problem of hyper pigmentation the popular cosmetologist of Nature ' s Essence Sunita Arora says ' the cells of skin are responsible for hyper pigmentation . .
These cells are called melanocytes .
These melanocyte cells produce a substance called melanin .
Problem of hyper pigmentation arises by overstimulation of these melanin cells in some parts of skin .
The main cause of hyper pigmentation is burning of skin in strong sunlight .
Various kinds of hormonal changes occur due to use of fertility and birth control pills .
Hormonal change makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight .
Hyper pigmentation can occur because of this .
Similarly many times complaint of hyper pigmentation can also occur due to medicines like Aminodaron , Mainosaiclin , tetracycline , and Blamaisin Saiclafosfemaid .
Hyper pigmentation that occurs due to change in hormones can heal on its own after pregnancy is over .
But many times its treatment becomes necessary .
There are two ways of treatment of hyper pigmentation .
In the first method there is use of bleaching agent on skin .
This bleaching agent neither bleaches the skin nor does it lighten the complexion of skin .
In fact it stops the excessive production of melanin .
This method of hyper pigmentation is very effective .
Bleaching agent ends the root cause of disease .
Now such essential oils have come that are helpful in rectifying the problem of pigmentation .
Regular use of essential oil gives better results .
Under the other ways of treatment such products are use that lighten the complexion of problematic skin .
Most products of this kind are sunscreen creams based on hydroquinone .
By this treatment problem of 60 to 70 % women gets fixed .
While using sunscreen keep this in mind that the cream you are using should be of high quality .
By use of a bad cream the effect of ultraviolet rays on skin increases rapidly .
Due to which danger of skin cancer increases .
There is a saying that prevention is better than cure .
To prevent hyper pigmentation maintain caution somewhat this way .
Since main cause of hyper pigmentation is strong sunlight hence save yourself from the sun .
Use an umbrella while going out of house .
Apply an mask of Fuller 's earth on skin and other open parts twice a week .
Splash your face and eyes with water after coming from outside and clean your face and arms with cleansing milk or the most effective home-made cleanser bran .
Apply juice of cucumber on face you will get relief .
If you have to get out in the sun then definitely apply a sunscreen of good company on your face and other exposed parts of your body .
When the complaint of hyper pigmentation starts get it treated only then .
Also try to find out if this problem is not because of the hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy .
Do not take the spots and freckles appearing on your body lightly consult a skin specialist as soon as there is such a problem .
Use herbal products .
Always use cosmetics of good quality .
If you have skin related problems then wear cotton clothes with full sleeves .
By this the rays of Sun will not be able to cause harm to you .
While going out in the sun do not forget to wear sunglasses .
Pay special attention to you diet .
On occurrence of complaint of pigmentation do not include many fried things in your diet .
Eat fresh fruits and fruit juice .
There are many ways of maintaining the beauty of skin you will just have to make an effort .
If you do not want to become a mother then there many kinds of contraceptives in the market .
Result is that life of women is now under their control .
Now they have more faith in themselves .
This time there is information of various kinds of contraceptives for you .
Contraceptives are of two kinds .
One temporary and the other permanent .
Use of temporary contraceptive can be stopped anytime .
But it is not so with permanent .
Those days are gone when women were dependent on men for family planning .
Here for a few years a lot of awareness has come amongst women regarding family planning .
Or you can say that due to arrival of many kinds of contraceptives for women self-confidence has developed in them and they have started feeling themselves as free .
Whether they want to be pregnant or not is their decision but women are in confusion due to arrival of many kinds of contraceptives .
They feel which method should be adopted , what are the side effects of a method , which have what benefits and which contraceptive is good for what age .
Normally 15 to 45 years of age is such an age - group in women in which they can get pregnant .
It can happen before fifteen years of age in some cases and also after 45 years of age .
Hence a woman should get cautious as soon as she comes in this age - group .
The woman who knows about the means of birth control properly only she can balance her life .
Before knowledge of means of birth control it is very important to have knowledge of your body .
There are two ovaries in a woman 's body .
Every month there is formation of an egg in them .
If that day there is union of egg with the sperm of male then the woman will get pregnant .
Therapists agree that this happens around the fourteenth day .
Hence those days if a woman uses the means of birth control or does not have sex with man then she will not get pregnant .
There are many ways for this .
Temporary birth control means that you can conceive stopping the use of birth control whenever you want .
You can never conceive again by permanent birth control .
One uses the birth control pills from the fifth day after the beginning of menstruation .
The most appropriate time for taking the birth control pills is the night time .
Birth control pills should be taken with milk before going to bed .
Here you are being told of the temporary birth control .
Natural method is that one in which after finding out the unsafe day one keeps away from sex on those days .
While continuing the activity of sex the man should ejaculate outside .
There are two ways of detecting the unsafe days .
First is that one should not have sex around the fourteenth day .
How to find out about the unsafe days around the fourteenth day ?
If your menstrual cycle is of 28 days meaning if your periods have started on the first date then we would consider time from eleventh to twentieth day as unsafe .
Birth control pills are known by the name of oral contraceptive .
The use of these pills is for those women who are unmarried , who do not have any child or they do not want a child soon after the wedding .
Other than this those women to whom Copper . does not suit .
It is good for women from 15 to 25 years of age to take this pill but only after a clinical examination .
These pills are of three kinds .
One is those in which there are synthetic hormones named estrogen and progesterone .
In the other kind of pills there is only progesterone .
It is for those women who are breastfeeding their children .
Third kind of pills are those in which there are no hormones like Saheli .
Some contraceptive pills are available in a pack of 21 pills like Ovral , Novelon , Femilon , etc . and some in packs of 28 pills like Mala . , Mala . .
Seven pills in a pack of 28 pills are those of iron and multivitamin .
If you forget someday then take it when you remember the next day or take two pills together .
Keep in mind if you forget too many times then these pills not do their work .
This way these pills provide 99 % protection from conception .
You should definitely keep getting clinically examined from time to time .
By taking birth control pills periods become regular .
Pain and bleeding during period lessens and there is prevention of anemia .
There is also prevention of breast tumor , ectopic pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis .
Other than this you get safe from the day you start taking pills .
Sometimes there is spotting from time to time , head reels for some time , or the menstrual month is very less .
Fungus infection occurs .
Nausea , vomiting , etc . these symptoms occur in the beginning on taking medicine .
Therefore doctor asks to take pills at night .
Headache and depression also occurs in many women .
But if you take pills with doctor 's advice then it is possible to prevent these kinds of side effects .
Intero uterine contraceptive device  IUD  is known as Copper . in common language .
Befitting the name it is in the form of a small T on which there is copper .
It is fitted inside the uterus by the doctor .
It is a painless and bloodless activity of only two minutes .
It is an easy and reliable method of birth control .
The success of Copper . is 98 % .
One uses it to give a gap after the first child between the second child .
Whenever there is desire to conceive you can get it out easily .
To apply this physician calls the desiring women immediately after menstruation only when there has been no relationship of woman - man and there has been no conception .
But at that woman should not have infection in her reproductive parts .
After fitting Copper . during menstruation a woman can feel the thread by inserting two fingers in her vagina .
You are not to pull this thread .
If there is no pain or pricking sensation then its alright .
One month after applying Copper . , after three months you should do clinical examination .
If you are having excessive pain in abdomen , there is much burning and itching , then you should show it to the physician immediately .
The duration of Copper . is of 3 years but certain such multiload Copper - Ts have become available in India which remain alright for five to ten years .
Other than this a Copper . has also come which comprises medicine and is for those women who have problem of excessive bleeding .
It works as a contraceptive also and problem of bleeding also gets cured .
There is no specific side effect of Copper . but it does not protect from sexual infections .
When is use of birth control not right ?
If a woman gets a temperature while taking birth control pills or pain in teeth .
If due to some reason she is taking antibiotic , she gets diarrhoea , so the efficiency of these pills reduces in such a state .
Hence in these conditions she should use other birth control methods like condom .
Those women who have diabetes , heart or liver problem should not take these pills at all .
These pills also should not be taken at all on there being high blood pressure , thyroid , bleeding disorder , etc .
Women infected with epilepsy and TB also should not take birth control pills .
Similarly those women should not apply a Copper . who are unmarried and who do not have a single child .
Those who have diabetes also should not fit Copper . .
There is one way of not allowing the sperm inside , condom .
It is known by the name of Nirodh .
Condom is used by men .
But if it is used properly then it provides protection up to 97 % .
Men should pull it on their erect penis carefully and keep it loose at the tip so that semen can accumulate there .
If you do not leave it loose at the tip then condom will tear during ejaculation and semen can enter the vagina .
For complete protection woman should keep a vaginal tablet inside her vagina .
It is possible to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases using condom .
Vaginal tablet is a good method of birth control for women .
If used the right way vaginal tablet provides 70 to 80 % protection .
This vaginal tablet is available by the name of Today .
Only woman makes use of vaginal tablet Today .
The advantage of it is that it is in the woman 's hands to use it when she wants to .
There are no side effects of vaginal tablet .
Contraceptive injectable are of two types .
If women decide to adopt this method then have to go to the doctor to get a depo injection .
You get depo injection for three months .
You get the injection that is for five years under the skin .
By applying injection of three months menstruation stops .
You have to get at an interval of every three months .
This injection does not provide protection from sexually transmitted infections .
There can be problems like headache , heaviness in breasts , nausea , disinterest in sex .
If ever because of some reason there is unprotected sex or occurrence of incidence like rape then you can prevent conception by using emergency contraception .
In this physician asks to eat two pills at an interval of twelve hours .
But this should not be used in routine .
Someday a situation also comes when you feel like you can not prevent unwanted pregnancy .
This is when emergency pills come useful .
In most families of Indian society the popular methods of family planning are adopted less even today .
Even if adopted the responsibility comes around and falls on the woman 's head only .
Either she gets sterilisation or takes aid of Copper . else pills but men often avoid sterilisation or use of condom .
As far as the question of contraceptives related to women is concerned they also have their advantages and disadvantages .
There is chance of infection by Copper . in woman 's genitals .
They advise those women who do not have any child or have only one child and want another child in future to avoid it .
Similarly taking pills also has its own difficulties .
Illiterates far from it even educated women forget to take them regularly .
They also have side - effects which can effect adversely on the bodies of women .
Perhaps this is the reason that despite running family planning programs on the both the levels of government as well as non - government even today women become unwanted mothers in a large number .
According to a report of national health survey even today 78 % of conceptions in India are unplanned .
In this also 25 % conceptions are such when husband - wife or woman does not want a child but conceive .
It is the result of this unplanned and unwanted conception that 70 lakh abortions out of the about one crore abortions occurring in the country are of one 's own will .
This is a reality that during abortion or because of complications borne out of it 20000 women have to lose their lives .
Today such a contraceptive is desperately required that can save women from unplanned or unwanted  especially in a condition of rape  pregnancies .
Anyhow popular contraceptives do not give women a hundred percent guarantee of not conceiving .
Condom tears during use  rate of success 84 %  then on slightest irregularity in taking pills undoes all that was done .
Natural contraception  based on the counting of menstrual cycle  is also in the same condition .
Most of the women do not even remember the date they had their last menstrual period .
They do not even know which days of the menstrual cycle are safe from the point of view of not conceiving .
In such a case emergency contraceptives prove very useful for women .
You can take these emergency pills within three to five days on having a fear of conceiving after having a physical relationship .
Their success rate is up to 75 - 90 percent .
If any woman feels that there was a mistake of some kind during physical intercourse and since she does not want a child then she can use these .
Emergency contraceptives are of two kinds - one steroid hormone pills and second Copper releasing intrauterine device .
In steroid hormone pills high dose pills come of estrogen , in combination of estrogen - progesterone and of only progesterone .
sterilisation meaning getting a freedom from pregnancy forever .
Sterilisation is also one of the popular methods of family planning .
From both man and woman anyone can get it done .
Sterilisation is a permanent and safe measure for birth control .
Before doing it you should mull over it properly that now you do not want children ahead .
After having sterilisation , opening it is a quite difficult and expensive process .
Then there is no hundred percent guarantee of its opening .
For sterilisation of man , opening his testicles a bit both tubes located there are closed , so that they are unable to take sperms from testicles .
This way sperms stop coming in the semen of the man and the woman is unable to conceive .
For semen to be completely sperm free it takes time of three months .
After that not finding sperms in semen test they can have sexual intercourse being carefree .
Vasectomy is a very simple procedure and you do not even need to make man unconscious for it .
This procedure gets over in only 10 - 15 minutes after numbing the local area and man can go home after 15 - 20 minutes .
He has to get his check up after rest of two days .
Then he can live his life like normal days .
He can even ride his bike a week after sterilisation .
Which men can get vasectomy ?
Such men who have crossed 50 years of age .
Are mentally healthy .
Who have at least one child above the age of one year .
When can women get sterilisation ?
They can get it anytime after getting healthy .
24 - 48 hours after having a normal delivery .
You can get sterilisation simultaneously on having a caesarean delivery .
But you can get sterilisation by telescope only six weeks after having delivery be it normal or Caesarean .
You can get sterilisation three months after abortion .
For a sterilisation of woman you either cut a part of her fallopian tube or you tie it via a ring or a clip .
You call this sterilisation tubectomy method .
In another method laparoscopic sterilisation a woman 's tubes are only tied by a ring or clip seeing through a telescope .
In psychological diseases also it is the question of vascular disease .
Medical therapists misdiagnose in relation to these diseases .

How and when to use water ?
If an individual upturns a lot of water in his stomach six to eight times in one meal then he would dissolve his gastric juice in such a way that it will not remain capable of doing its job as a digestive juice .
This way he will not only fill his stomach with six or eight layers but will also give it distress .
In this condition if his stomach moans with pain , his digestion is bad like it happens before then how can he complain .
Then how should you do the regulation of water intake .
If you realize a thirst before having meal then surely drink .
Thirst informs of necessity of fluid in body .
Other than this gastric juice is thick which keeps needing dissolution .
Do not drink water at all while having a meal .
Even if you drink water , drink very less in which impure gastric juice enters all food substances even in the last morsel properly .
If after having your meal on lapse of a long time if the mixture of food substances again demands some fluid to assist stomach in digestion .
In other words if after 1 . or 3 hours you feel a thirst then you can drink but in moderation .
Whenever you feel thirst drink water but the amount should not be much .
The body especially the stomach has an expectation of a fluid substance for mixing and increasing the gastric juice and for bringing in its control all the solid substances from time to time .
When neglected it keeps informing of it by itself .
Sometimes this desire for water knocks slowly and sometimes it screams and calls loudly in the form of extreme thirst .
Water taken in small amount is immediately accepted by the gastric juice and gets mixed in it easily .
Its frequency occurring every half an hour provides with more fluid .
It removes all immobility and constipation bringing a cooling and softening and dissolving while flowing through the body and intestines ordinarily .
You should drink half pound of cold water as soon as you wake up in the morning .
If the water is kept in a brass utensil it will be more beneficial .
Pyria is a kind of a disease of teeth .

There are total 33 vertebrae in the spine .
Out of which four vertebrae are related to the neck .
The spinous processes emerging out of these vertebrae control the brain , eyes , forehead , ears , nose , tongue , palate , mouth , teeth , thyroid gland and elbows .

The family planning program was started in the country from 1951 .
Its aim was only to plan the population .
Afterwards for the attainment of the missions of the program it started being used for mass education and propaganda .
In the decade of seventies by stressing on vasectomy extreme strictness was done in the achievement of goals .
As a result opposition was produced among masses towards family planning program .
During the seventh plan year 1985 - 90 in place of the family planning program the program was given the identity of family welfare .
In this special emphasis was given on the health related needs of women of reproductive age and children of less than five years .
In 1985 - 86 pervasive vaccination was started .
In pervasive vaccination the aim was fixed to bring down the death rate and sickness of young children from such diseases whose prevention is possible through vaccines .
Thereafter by looking at the benefits of this program in the decade of nineties child safety and safe motherhood  C . . . .  was prepared and implemented from 1992 - 93 .
In the present times all the family welfare services continuing from before were kept implemented .
In it reproductive health , youth health , sex generated disease , infection of reproductive system and AIDS were included .
It was given the name of reproduction and child health .
Reproduction and child health program was implemented in the region .
In the place of goal oriented method from the year 1997 community needs are ascertained on the basis of assessment policy .
The work plan of health workers only would be the base of all the plans .
After unifying the plans created on the sub centres it would be given the form of district work plan .
The district work plans together would take the form of state work plan .
In order to supply the goods to state the national plan would be based on the state work plan .
The partner plan is the form of proposal .
The principle essay of the ninth plan published by the planning commission has been written .
It is written in it that the government investment during the eighth plan for family welfare is reducing .
The extra expenditure of the eighth plan has also been less than that of the seventh plan .
This situation looks even more unsatisfactory .
At every level there is a need of upliftment of health care system .
The health care program should be made to reach to more and more people .
So that at the end the national goal may be achieved .
However because of the economic development , spread of education  literacy and due to the rights given to the citizens there has been a constant improvement in the program in the past years .
In the states with less execution many problems are present in relation to weak implementation , because of the women not receiving enough rights and education  literacy .
Under the reproduction and health program the solution to these problems would be achieved through the following strategy .
Giving importance to community participation in planning and services .
Adopting consumer centric arrangement in services .
Arrangement of high standard services and better training .
Removal of contraceptive goal and encouragement .
Making the services gender sensitive .
Adoption of multidimensional methods in the implementation and monitoring of services .
Under the child safety and safe motherhood  C . . . .  plan in the unification process of the programs one more step was taken in 1994 .
In the population and development conference in the country of Egypt the proposal for the unification of reproduction and child health  R . . .  programs were tabled .
In the reproduction and child health policy it has been emphasized on this thing that people should have the power to control reproductive force .
Women may be able to get safe conception .
Couple should be able to keep sexual relation without the fear of conception or disease .
Accordingly the mission of the ninth plan was kept that all the related programs of eighth plan would be unified .
The goal of reproduction and child health  R . . .  conceptualization is that according to the requirement decided by them high standard reproduction and child health .
Reproductive and child health  R . . .  is a unified program .
In this apart from other things the support of the organizations of Indian government and the support of external international organization of world bank and European commission etc are included .
It is the right of the citizens that good quality of reproductive and health services are available to them .
Therefore the mission of reproductive and child health program is to make available services of good quality .
So that for the citizens reliable reproduction and health can be ensured .
In this program the quality of the services have been clarified .
The quality of the services is that only which we want for our family .

In order to save pregnant women from tetanus two vaccines are given at the interval of one month .
In the pregnancy the difficulties are identified and accounted .
If complications arise in delivery then immediately she should be sent to such unit where the diagnosis and treatment of complications is possible .
It is essential that the care of woman post delivery is taken by female health worker .
If post delivery complications arise then the woman should be referred to the proper health unit .
The meaning of anemia is deficiency of blood in the body .
Maximum women are affected by anemia in India .
In the blood of anaemic women there occurs the deficiency of iron and folic acid .
Because of which the quantity of hemoglobin gets reduced in their blood .
In normal male and female the quantity of hemoglobin in blood should be 14 and 12 respectively .
In pregnant women this level is generally found less .
The detection of anemia in pregnant women is generally through some of these symptoms .
Due to anemia there is feeling of weakness in normal days .
Pregnant woman suffering from malaria may suffer from anemia .
Because of anemia the symptoms of the paleness of face , dark circles under the eyes , paleness of nails , whitening of tongue , vomiting , swelling in feet , loss of appetite , headache etc are found .
Among the anaemic patients in India the number of pregnant women is the maximum .
In normal condition on the occurrence of anemia the immune capacity of the body reduces .
There is fatigue and weakness in this but during pregnancy on the occurrence of anemia this becomes harmful for the woman as well as her prospective child .
Anemia is the chief reason for maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate .
Due to anemia the weight of the new born baby may become very less than normal .
The new born baby may be born handicapped physically or mentally .
In anaemic women the milk is also not produced enough for the child .
The prevention and treatment of anemia .
Anemia chiefly occurs due to the reason of deficiency of iron elements in the food materials .
The requirement of iron elements in pregnant women is more than normal .
Therefore such substances in which there is more iron like vegetables , salad , jaggery etc should definitely be included in food .
In pregnant women whose level of hemoglobin in blood is from 5 . they have the requirement of treatment with caution in the care of the doctor itself .
One pill of iron should be given daily to pregnant woman for three months from three months after getting pregnant .
If the woman is pregnant before pregnancy then two pills of iron  one morning one evening  should be given to her for 100 days .
New born baby keeps getting iron in sufficient quantity from mother 's milk .
If any child is anaemic then normally it should be given one pill of iron daily after the age of 6 months .
One chief reason of anemia in women and children is the existence of worms in their body .
As for example if there is hookworm in someone 's stomach then the hookworm drinks 0 . millilitre of blood from his body daily .
Therefore for protection against anemia it is very important to give this advice that women  children should wear footwear .
For protection against anemia the vegetable etc should be eaten after washing .
In order to be safe from anemia keep the nails short and clean so because of which any type of worm does not enter inside their body .
For protection against tetanus two vaccines should be put at the interval of one month .
First vaccine should be given immediately on the detection of pregnancy .
Due to this both mother and the child to be born would stay healthy .
Before delivery at least three tests are extremely important before delivery .
Pregnancy has been divided in three parts .
First three months  trimester  - from the first day of the last menstruation to 12 weeks .
Second three months  trimester  - 13 weeks to 28 weeks .
Third three months  trimester  - 29 weeks to 40 weeks .
Normal pregnancy is from the first day of the last menstruation for up to 280 days .
Female health worker and maid should take proper care of the new born child .
If there are complications in the new born baby then it should be referred to the right unit .
For the treatment of diarrhoea of children the solution of O . . . Should be used by the female health workers .
Imparting information of O . . . to the family is important .
For the treatment of pneumonia in children the use of cotrimoxazol should be done .
It is important for every health worker to have information about nutrition .
Health workers should certainly make available information related to the nutrition to each family .
It is extremely important for the body to get protein , iron , folic acid , vitamin ' A ' and iodine in proper quantity .
In pregnancy the growth of foetus is possible only when the pregnant woman is healthy and properly fed .
Therefore during pregnancy the pregnant woman has the requirement of one and half times more food and rest .
In food protein , milk , fish , eggs , and cereals , various types of pulses , vegetables , peanuts and gram etc should be taken in sufficient quantity .
In women especially the pregnant women the use of iron and folic acid should be started quickly .
The pregnant women are made to use hundred pills of iron and folic acid for safety and two hundred pills for the sake of treatment .
There will not be complete benefit on the use of less pills by pregnant woman .
Vitamin A solution is extremely beneficial for children .
Five doses of vitamin A should be given at the interval of 6 months .
Due to this the child stays free from various diseases .
Because of the use of vitamin A solution on the occurrence of any disease even the intensity of the disease will not increase .
Vitamin A also protects from blindness .
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A the disease of night blindness occurs .
This disease night blindness changes into blindness later on .
Iodine is an extremely nutritive substance for body .
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A diseases like abortion , deafness in children , dumbness , mental retardation , physical handicappedness and goitre may occur .
In order to prevent these diseases it is essential that the use of iodine rich salts should be done in each family .
For family limitation various contraceptives are available at sub - centres .
In order to keep proper gap between two children I . . .  copper T  is implanted by female health workers .
Pills which can be eaten and nirodh are also distributed .
To couples having two or more children the advice of male or female tubectomy is given .
In men the facility of vasectomy is available without incision and stitches for free .
The detection of patients of diarrhoea , cholera , whooping cough , diphtheria , tetanus , polio , measles , tuberculosis , leprosy and malaria should be done .
The detection of patients of reproductive system infection , sex produced diseases and AIDS should be done and advice regarding protection and treatment should be given .
To keep record of birth and death in the region and informing village panchayat officer .
Because of cold affecting the child cold , fever , and cough happens .
If the treatment is not done quickly then pneumonia happens to the child .
On the occurrence of pneumonia if proper treatment is not done then the death of child may even occur .
According to the figures available in the hospital in the ward of children the reason of 13 percent of total infant mortality is pneumonia .
Therefore information of the status of pneumonia , identification of danger , treatment and where to refer the complicated cases is very important .
In the initial stage domestic treatment and in the situation of seriousness by referring to the right place many children can be saved .
many times due to the lack of proper information also the deaths of children occur .
The identification of pneumonia and management .
When the child has cold and cough both then pneumonia may occur to him .
the identification of pneumonia happens due to rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs .
With cough rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs .
Together with above symptoms fever , fatigued child , difficulty in breathing .
The methods of management may be the following .
Safe and proper medicine is available .
The treatment may take place at home by the mother .
The child has the need of treatment with cotrimoxazole .
There is need to refer the child .
While counting the rate of breathing special things should be kept in mind .
At the time of the counting of breathing rate the child must be relaxing or sleeping .
The child should be crying or in difficulty .
For this choose any peaceful place in the clinic .
For counting the rate of breathing the lower portion of the chest or back should be completely uncovered .
By using the seconds needle in your watch count the breathing rate in one minute .
How to identify fast breathing rate ?
In child of less than two months of age the rate of breathing being 60 per minute or more .
In child from 2 to 15 months 50 per minute or more .
In the age of 1 to 5 years of age in the condition of pneumonia 40 per minute or more .
If the breathing rate is more than the above mentioned levels then count again and finalize your diagnosis .
While seeing the movement of ribs keep in mind special things .
The meaning of the movement of ribs is that the movement of the lower part of the chest certainly towards inside with breathing .
Only the soft tissue between the ribs or the upper part of the collar bone goes inside with the breathing of the child .
This will not be called the movement of the ribs .
The movement of the ribs have been defined in the form of sub costal suction or pull .
The movement of ribs in small children is normal thing .
The sight if ribs very clearly  very deep and easy to see  may be the sign of pneumonia .
If you are doubtful about the ribs of the child then change the position of the child and check again .
If the body of the child is bent from waist then the decision of the speed of the lower part of the chest is doubtful .
Change the position of the child in such manner that he keeps lying straight in the lap of the mother .
Despite this if the movement of the ribs is not seen clearly then it should be believed that the ribs are not moving .
the movement of the ribs is important only when it moves continuously and is seen clearly .
If this is seen only in the unhappy state of the child or while it is taking nutrition and not in the state of rest then believe that there is no rib movement .
Symptoms of extremely serious pneumonia .
The child feeling more sleepy and difficulty in waking up .
The noise of throat clearing even when silent .
Production of sound in the breathing of the child or occurrence of fits .
Extreme malnutrition to the child .
Fever or feeling of cold on touching in very small child .
According to the rate of breathing treatment may be done at home or at health center .
In case of serious pneumonia admit the patient in the hospital .
In extreme pneumonia certainly admit the child in such a hospital or health center where the facility of oxygen is available .
Children less than two months of age in whom there is rapid breathing rate they should be treated for serious pneumonia .
Those children in whom there are symptoms of pneumonia and are malnourished they should be taken to the hospital immediately .
In order to escape from the danger of pneumonia inform the mother .
Keep the new born baby warm .
Feed only mother 's milk to the child up to six months .
To children older than six months give other substances apart from milk .
Definitely get the D . . . and measles vaccination at the right time .
Before touching , feeding milk and feeding food to children especially new born babies certainly wash the hands .
Control the fever with the paracetamol tablet .
Certainly give the right dose of antibiotic to children suffering from pneumonia .
Counsel the mother repeatedly , till the time it is not sure that the mother has understood this matter that it is essential to give special attention to children suffering from pneumonia .
If in the feeding of the child the nose is obstructing then for its cleaning  reduction of sticky substance  use salty water .
Give more liquid to the child to drink .
Remove the irritation of the throat and cure the cough through safe treatment .
For getting rid of cough lemon , honey , ginger , basil , hot water etc domestic treatment should be encouraged .
Nutritive food and clean water , hygiene and vaccination these are the three most important body protectors .

There is deep relation between food and health .
With balanced diet balanced health is made .
before independence the situation of drought and hunger used to generally arise in our country .
Today due to the reason of mentionable achievements in the field of agriculture in the past decades the production of cereals , vegetables and fruits has increased many times .
But unfortunately in the country the rate of population increase has advanced faster than the rate of increase of cereals .
The growth of population has happened more in the section of poor people only .
Due to this some very well off people became unhealthy because of over nutrition .
That problem of malnutrition is looming even today in front of the maximum poor population .
Poverty and lack of purchasing power are chief reasons for malnutrition of a large section of population of our country .
There are some ill effects of malnutrition .
There is a deep relation between malnutrition and unhealthiest .
Because of lack of purchasing power of maximum population of India they are not able to take nutritious food .
They stay victims of under nutrition .
In such situation they also have to do hard physical labor for their livelihood .
Due to under nutrition the energy balance  negative energy balance  of their body reduces .
As a result their capacity to work reduces .
Due to undernourishment the disease - immune capacity of the body also decreases .
Due to this unhealthiest increases .
Malnutrition has very bad effect on reproduction and child health .
Therefore for reproduction and child health the knowledge of facts related to nutrition is essential .
The estimation of the nutrition status of any person is helpful in keeping him healthy .
Generally this is measured by the condition of the weight of the person , age , height , hemoglobin in blood and other elements .
Malnutrition only is the health problem - reason is not poverty but lack of information .
For keeping the child healthy there is need to have enough information to the mother and the family members .
Large number of children India are left malnourished .
While the things of their need is available in the nature itself .
For this there is no need of extra money .
The need is of the information that what should be the right diet to be given to the children by which the children may stay healthy .
the girls should also be given food equal to that of boys .
Abstain from food like alcohol , tobacco , excess oil rich food , excess chilli and spices , excess sugar and salt and excess tea , coffee .
the foundation of the health of the child starts from the pregnancy itself .
The kind of food which the pregnant woman gets the growth of the child also takes place according to it .
Thus , from pregnancy itself it is important for the child to get nutritional food .
Here the meaning of nutritive is not expensive food but food rich with vitamin , protein , and iron substances .
In what situation the food of the child may be cheap and nutritive ?
In pregnancy food should be consumed in the right quantity and nutritive .
In food eat such things in which iron elements , vitamin A and iodine are in rich quantity .
There is the need of vitamin A to the pregnant woman .
For eye sight there is the need of vitamin A to every woman .
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A night blindness may occur in pregnant woman and mother who has already fed milk  who has fed milk to child  .
If there would be deficiency of vitamin A in mother then this deficiency would be there in the child as well .
Due to this even the eye sight of the child may also go .
Due to the deficiency of vitamin A there is high risk of contracting other infections as well .
There should not be the deficiency of vitamin A by eating green leafy vegetables like lettuce , pot herb , mustard , cabbage , radish , gram lentil .
The fruits and vegetables of yellow color like mango , papaya , carrot and gourd are beneficial in removing the deficiency of vitamin A .
These things are easily available in rural districts .
Apart from this you can also take curd , cheese , eggs , liver in the food .
By giving the child nutritional substance along with breast feeding we make the child healthy and capable of fighting with the infections .
After one year if the upper arm of the child is less than 13 c . . then he is malnourished .
If it is less than 12 c . . then he is malnourished in the extreme form .
There is the requirement of iodine to pregnant women .
Due to the deficiency of iodine apart from the disease of goitre many other harmful conditions may arise .
Due to the deficiency of iodine the child may have mental retardation .
The child may be miscarried or may be born dead .
the child may be deaf or dumb .
There could be stiffness like paralysis in the bone of his knee .
Some quantity of iodine is obtained by us from water and vegetables .
Due to the reason of environmental pollution we do not get the proper quantity of iodine .
Always keep the iodine salt in closed vessel , not in uncovered vessel .
Because of coming getting air in uncovered vessel dampness comes in the salt .
Because of this the iodine mixed in salt does not stay in the proportion to the body .
What should be the proper type of food for child ?
In the life and growth of the child his weight at the time of birth plays a very important role .
In Indian conditions the weight of the child at the time of birth should normally be 2 . k . .
The weight of one third of children at the time of birth is found to be less than 2 . . . .
In infant mortality rate the number of children less than 2 k . . Is found to be maximum .
Children of less weight are born to mothers suffering from anemia .
The quantity of hemoglobin of mother at the time of birth is less than 8 then the weight of the child at the time of birth may be very less .
For such women there is need of A . . .
The child having less weight at the time of birth depends on the nutritional condition of the mother .
The nutritional condition of the mother depends on the financial condition of the mother .
The child having less weight at the time of birth are generally related to poor families .
On not taking excess protein the face stay swelled , decolouring of hair and skin , thinning of upper arm , flakes on the skin and hands and feet stay swelled .
Right from the time of birth it is important to give special attention to food for good health of the child .
In order to make the child disease free the child must get the first milk of the mother .
the child should not be given tonic , honey etc .
certainly make the child drink mother 's milk .
the milk of mother protects the child from diseases .
In the milk of mother there is vitamin A and all nutritive elements .
In the mother 's milk there are those nutritive elements which are not found in any milk .
Mother 's milk is food and medicine for the child .
Mother 's milk is beneficial to the child economically as well .
In sickness the child gets help from mother 's milk in becoming alright .
While feeding the child special attention should be given to the child for cleanliness .
The child should be fed till the time he does not start asking for food on his own .
Approximately 33 percent children are of less weight at the time of birth  less than 2 . kilogram  .
But within 6 months this rate remains 15 percent .
Such happens because in all the communities there has been validity of feeding up to six months of birth .
The child keeps getting nutritive substance from the milk of the mother .
The weight of children of the age group of 6 - 11 months and 12 - 23 months gets reduced  under weight  again .
Its first reason is that starting to give other food materials apart from mother 's milk long before six months .
Or else not starting to give any other food materials apart from mother 's milk even after six months .
its second reason is , due to the reason of infection increase in the rate of disease  morbidity rate  .
In order to escape from both these problems it is essential that the family members should be given the information about nutrition education .
Even after six months other food materials should be given together with mother 's milk .
Generally nutritive food materials should be given 4 . times in a day in balanced quantity .
For protection against diseases cleanliness especially the purity of the drinking water should be paid attention to .
the children of 2 . years generally start eating .
Due to this improvement comes also in children born with less weight .
The information of availability of nutritive substances at low price should be given to the families of children of this age group .
This information is imparted under various programs like woman and child development department and family welfare programs .
The children from 5 to 14 years of age generally come in the group of school going children .
They are distributed medical tests and nutritive diet under the mid - day meal program and school health program .
the children who do not go to school stay devoid of this .
In the ninth five year plan the registration of all the children in the school , continuation of the mid - day program and test of the weight of children and disease should be arranged .
In youth the physical and mental growth occur very fast .
In youth there is requirement of various nutritive elements .
Sufficient attention is not given on the nutrition of people of this age group .

The wealthy section become victim of obesity .
Due to marriage or conception in young age generally anemia or reduced hemoglobin are found .
It ill effect is seen both on the mother and the prospective child .
To solve these problems information is imparted trough the media of the programs like health education , nutrition education and I . . . . Programme and R . . . program .
Nutritive food is the mantra for good health .
the strength to fight against disease is obtained from food .
The child of the body also needs this strength .
For this the most important are vitamin A and iron elements .
At least three to four times in a week the child should be given vitamin A rich food .
Every second day half bowl of lentils should be fed .
Due to this there would not be any deficiency of vitamin A .
Deep impact falls on the eyes due to the deficiency of vitamin A .
To keep a check on growth the weight of the children less than six years is also taken in anganbari .
Apart from this for the growth of children information regarding right upbringing , information of vaccination and knowledge of health is also imparted .
Apart from this here proper education is also given for the mental growth of children .
This way it has become clear that for pregnant woman and child there is no need of any such food which is very expensive .
In rural districts also the facility of anganbari is available .
the girls are also in need of that much of food as the boys .
generally it has been seen that in comparison to boys less attention is paid in the upbringing of girls .
It is said that later on boys have to earn .
The boys will only fulfil the major responsibilities of the house .
While apart from the responsibilities of the house the girls have to give birth to children later on .
If the girls are weak then post marriage their children will also be weak .
If the vicious cycle of early marriage and less birth duration is maintained then the prospective children would be weak .
Therefore how much important nutritious food is for boys that much it is also for girls .
Vitamin A has high importance for child .
New born baby gets vitamin A from mother 's milk .
On not getting mother 's milk night blindness may occur in children .
With the vaccination of measles the dose of vitamin A is given .
The virus of measles and chicken pox affect the stock of vitamin A of the body .
Generally the child does not die of measles or chicken pox but due to infections happening after that like pneumonia , dysentery , brain fever etc .
If pregnant women and their family members are given these informations then definitely mother and child may be protected from becoming the victims of malnutrition .
For protecting the child from malnutrition the requirement is not of more money but of right knowledge .
There are many forms of malnutrition .
By taking excess carbohydrate and not taking protein substance kwashiorkor .
Marasmus on not getting more food .  deficiency of everything protein , carbohydrate and fat   marasmus  .

Due to the facilities at present reduction has come in the physical labor of man .
Because of this reason the problem of obesity has come up .
Because of excess food the quantity of many substances start reaching in the blood of man more than normal .
Due to this diseases like heart disease , diabetes etc start occurring .

The reason of not feeding colostrums  first milk  to the child .
Colostrums is thrown because people say that it is accumulated stale milk of 5 . months , this will harm the child .
Therefore in place of colostrums people give the first diet of tonic , milk , honey and water , powder milk etc .
First milk is beneficial to the child but what is the benefit it is not known .
To encourage mother so that she starts feeding the child her own milk immediately after birth .
What is colostrums ?
Why is it essential to feed colostrums ?
How should the baby be fed the milk so that the lactation can be fast ?
The first milk of mother is thick , yellow and sticky substance , which is called colostrums or first milk .
It is essential to give colostrums to the child .
Immediately after the birth  within 1 hour  certainly feed it your milk .
This thick and yellow milk is the elixir for the child .
The natural substances present in it save it from contracting dysentery , cold , cough etc diseases .
In this the vitamin A substance beneficial for the child is present in huge quantity .
It helps in the expulsion of the black faeces of the child .
Never understand this that the first secreted milk is bad or indigestible .
This is a wrong thought , on the contrary the substances which are quick to digest are found in more quantity which is suitable for the new born baby .
After delivery it comes out for two three days with the milk of the mother .
Many times the child is not able to suck the breast properly , but keep trying , it will very quickly .
Whether milk comes out or not let the baby suck both the breasts certainly for at least half an hour one after the other , do such many times , the mother will start lactating the very first day .
During the breast feeding the full part of areola  the dark portion around the nipple  should be inside the mouth of the child .
When the child will suck the dark part then the mother 's milk will be secreted fast and will be produced more .
Giving tonic , making honey lick , giving the solution of sugar and water to the new born baby are old customs and traditions .
Doing such is harming the child .
Do not give cow milk , buffalo milk , goat milk by mixing with water to the new born baby .
This may harm the baby .

Alzheimer 's disease has also been seen on hereditary levels .
Mainly three stages have been seen of Alzheimer 's .
First stage - loss of memory , delusion , reduction of judgement , loss of interest towards things or people , repeated forgetfulness , difficulties in daily life , irritation etc .
Second stage - restlessness during evening time , increase of delusion , weakening of memory even more , not feeling the sensation of heat and cold , loss of control on excretion , repeating the words several times , anger , quarrelling , becoming obstinate , loss of hair .
Third stage - speaking words with difficulty , not recognizing family members , friends and close relatives , complete dependence on others , absolute no control on excretion , increase of sleep disorders , incompetence of getting up and sitting , comma at the end .
Why does the disease of Alzheimer 's occur , its absolutely correct cause has not yet been known .
Although some dangerous chromosomes of Alzheimer 's have certainly been known .
the danger of increase of the disease of Alzheimer 's increases with age .
For example if any person in the family has Alzheimer 's , then his blood relatives can also be at that much big risk .
Due to hereditary reasons Alzheimer 's generally shows its impact in the age of 35 - 60 years .
For the treatment of Alzheimer 's or to be saved from it improvement in blood circulation can be an effective medical treatment .
Such medicines are available , by which the loss in the mental capacity can be lessened .
In the initial stage of the disease of Alzheimer 's the depression of the treatment can be treated but not for long time .
Behave normally to the patient of Alzheimer 's , do not make fun of him .
be compassionate towards the patient of Alzheimer 's and keep patience .
Keep within the reach of the patient the things which come to use daily like spectacles , watch and denture .
Do not keep any sharp or dangerous object like knife etc near the patient of Alzheimer 's .
The bed of the patient of Alzheimer 's should be comfortable , good sleep can come to him .
Listen to the talks of the patient of Alzheimer 's attentively .
Behave with love and compassion with the patient of Alzheimer 's .
While sleeping there is risk of the patient falling , therefore do not make him lie on high bed and the bathroom should also be close to the bed .
Do not argue with the patient of Alzheimer 's and do not leave him lonely .
Be very careful about the safety of the patient of Alzheimer 's .
Such patients should be inspired for pranayam , yogasadhana and exercise .
Medicines like Brahmi powder or Brahmi Vati , Shankhapushpi powder , Ashwagandha powder , Brahmi oil , Jyotishmati oil , Kushmandadhool etc . are fruitful in the alzheimer 's disease .
By exercising , reduction in the quantity of cholesterol and controlling high tension protection from Alzheimer 's can be done efficiently .
The disease of Alzheimer 's can be pushed a little more back by antioxidant , vitamin and good diet .
If people be careful in the beginning , then one can be safe against Alzheimer 's disease .
For body the main source of energy is carbohydrate .
In maximum food materials there is carbohydrate , which the body changes into sugar .
For doing any work we get energy from carbohydrate alone .
In food materials two types of carbohydrates are found - simple and complex .
Simple carbohydrate is found in white sugar , fruits and milk .
Therefore the consumption of fruits and milk should be done .
Because in this there are nutrients like vitamin , fiber and calcium , which are not available in simple sugar .
Complex carbohydrate is also called starch .
In complex carbohydrate maida , white bread , white rice , pastries , pasta and junk food etc are included .
Consume complex carbohydrate rich substances less , because these substances digest late and produce the complications of constipation etc .
Due to substances rich in complex carbohydrate the problems of pimples etc are produced .
Instead of low carbohydrate consume good carbons like - whole cereals , pulses , fruits , vegetables and sauce .
On the occurrence of fungal infection you must have seen many people applying henna .
henna gives cooling effect and also functions as astringent .
Apart from this henna is useful in reducing the temperature of the body , curing headache .
henna is also useful in removing the inflammation of the legs .
It gives relief in problems like excessive sweating in palms .
In many Oriental countries the use of henna is done in the form of medicine .
In Morrocco in order to keep the house cool the residents even paint the door of the house with henna .
In henna there is one such chemical which is helpful in leprosy , small pox , headache .
Henna is useful in removing problems like burnt skin , wound and eczema .
If there is fever , then apply the paste of henna in palms , fever will lower fast .
In a new study it has been found that during pregnancy the chances of the children suffering from asthma is more for women who stay tensed .
According to the researchers of Bristol university if during pregnancy the women are treated for tension then the cases of asthma can be stopped from increasing .
In Britain 10 lac children and 40 lac adults are suffering from patient .
According to the chief researcher Professor John Handerson . Due to tension only many types of hormones get secreted in our body whose effect is seen on the child and its immune system during pregnancy which spreads in the form of disease like asthma in future . .
In this study 14 thousand children of 5800 families were included .
The researchers had asked questions even to the mothers of these children .
Whenever a person is ill , then he knows that which medicine he has to take and how much to take .
It is also important for him to know that when it is beneficial for him to take the medicine .
If the disease is in the lower part of the body , then the consumption of medicine before the meal is beneficial .
If the body is to be thinned , then the medicine should be taken before meal .
In the ailments of stomach , abnormalities of bile the use of medicine should be done in the middle of the meal .
Strong people should generally take the medicine empty stomach .
For the upper parts of the body the medicine should be taken after the meal .
Medicines for cough produced ailments and to make the body fat should be taken after the meal .
Boys , girls , fragile and those hating the medicine should take it with the meal .
In respiratory diseases , cough , intense thirst , vomiting and poison related diseases the instruction is to take the medicine a little after meal .
In diseases of ear , nose , throat and eyes it is beneficial to take the medicine before going to sleep at night .
Weak and people observing fast should abstain from medicine .
The consumption of medicines which are repulsive and of intense smell can also be used before meal .
Children actually jump around enough the entire day then why do they need to exercise ?
If you also think such and do not inspire your child for exercise , then in one way you are compromising with his growth .
The university of Illinois did a study on the physical education and exercise in children and discovered its multiple benefits .
It was found in the study that positive influence can be seen on the study of the physical education class , exercise program in recess time and after school .
The study done by professor of community health Charles Hillman says that physical education enhances the ability of the student to concentrate .
Prof . Hillman said . the aim of this study was to know whether light exercise like , walk can even have good impact on the health of child . .
During the research the study was done on three bases .
During this a positive link was seen between physical activity , concentration and academic achievement .
In the study 8 girls and 12 boys of 9 years participated .
In order to know there control power many stimulus tests were done .
In the research it was seen that children who walked everyday did the test in better way .
So far that even to complete difficult challenge these students did less mistakes .
It was also seen that even in the midst of noisy environment these students were able to do the work with more concentration .
Because of all this much improvement was seen in the reading , spelling and maths .
Mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern lifestyle may also become the cause of the spread of disease .
Here in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of ' Washi ' situated MGM hospital this fact has come up .
In the study the phones of more than 82 percent of the workers of the hospital have been found to be the carriers of the microbes and spores of contagious diseases .
By this there is chance of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , acne - blisters , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases .
In this study done by the Indian Medical Research Council 120 mobile phones of the workers were tested .
The researcher Dr . Nikhil Tambe final year M . . . . student of MGM hospital found that bacteria and spores were found on 99 phones out of them .
This bacteria together with making the disease of the patient serious also become the cause of the delay of the cure .
Tambe said that the presence of the maximum number of bacteria were found in the phones of the technicians .
After this the mobile phones of ward boy , nurse and then doctors were found infected serially .
Dr . Chitra Pai , chief of the microbiology department of the hospital said that on the mobile phones maximum 54 . percent ' staphylococcus accrues ' bacteria were found .
This microbe can become the cause of skin disease .
Apart from this in mobile phones microbes like E - Coli and pseudomonas were also found .
Due to the infection of E - Coli and pseudomonas microbes maximum ill effect is seen on the health .
Two years back in a study done in Coimbatore the presence of 96 . percent microbes was found on the phones of hospital workers .
First let me tell you as to what are antioxidants ?
As our age passes some or the other type of loss occurs in our body .
We generally see that some people appear old before age while some appear comparitively young even at the age of 80 years .
The answer to this is with modern medical science and this answer is the deficiency of antioxidant in our food .
All around us there is pollution , tensile environment and many among us smoke cigarette actively .
All this speed up the process of destruction in body after uniting .
Even the diseases of the heart to great extent can be due to this destructive process .
Just like the rust on the iron exposed in air  which occurs due to oxidation  the cause of the destruction in the body is also oxygen and tissues  the chemical reaction of the enzymes .
The accumulated fat in the arteries of the heart  L . . . Cholesterol  gets oxidised before getting accumulated .
Antioxidants are micronutrient substances which stop the destruction occurring in the tissues and organs of the body .
Therefore these have immense capacity to keep the disease of the heart at bay and for its treatment  reversal  .
Along with antioxidants there are other substances as well which are essential to make the food complete which help our heart and other organs and make our body healthy and increase the immune capacity of our body .
This collection of the information of heart , throw light on these food making it complete .
This is the wonder food of future antioxidants .
In continuous fast life generally man is left devoid of nutrition or else stays dependent on diet consisting of less nutrition .
In this relation can we think something for ourselves or our family instead .
This is that portion of knowledge related to nutrition which has been specially created for us .
Every capsule of this knowledge give us information about vitamins and minerals , which are important for our health .
What are free radicals ?
In what way do these harm human body ?
In what way Vitamin E and other antioxidant nutritive substances protect the body from the destruction of free radicals .
We will try to give answers to these questions and will tell that fruits and vegetables rich in 5 . types of antioxidants may be beneficial for your health .
For the knowledge of this thing that how free radicals and antioxidants react with each other , little bit of knowledge is essential in the subject of tissues and molecules .
Physiology , for the revision of chemistry brief chapters have been given here .
Human body is made up of various types tissues and tissues are made up of various types of molecules .
In molecules there may be one or more atoms which remain tied due to chemical bond .
In atom there are nucleus , neutron , proton and electron .
Electrons participate in chemical reactions and keep the atom tied in the form of molecule .
Electron keeps the atom surrounded in one or many shells .
Certainly oxygen element is extremely important for life , but in some conditions it is even harmful for human body .
Due to the reactivity of oxygen many harmful compounds are formed .
These are called the compounds of reactive oxygen species .
Reactive oxygen compound give oxygen to other substances according to their own nature .
Many out of these reactive species are free radicals and consist of one or more extra electron .
This way because of the lack of similar compounds it is the cause of instability and extreme reactivity .
Oxygen atom is the cause of the reason of ageing , heart disease , stiffening of the artery , the reason of loss of immune capacity , damage of free radicals .
Due to these losses the conditions of stiffness of the arteries , diabetes , cataract and premature agreeing arise .
The contribution of antioxidant is extremely effective in the prevention of cancer , heart disease , Alzheimer 's disease , rheumatism and cataract .
Together with different oxidants these work in different cellular compartments .
The system of enzyme is an important aspect of immunity capacity , glutathione peroxidise , superoxide dismutase and catalase etc which reduce the accumulation of some harmful oxidants in the tissues .
Some essential minerals are - selenium , copper , manganese and zinc etc are essential for the production of the activity of the live enzymes .
Another security line of the immune capacity of the body towards the harm of the free radicals is the presence of antioxidants .
Antioxidants is a molecule which is at least so stable that they can give one electron to free radicals and make them inert so that their capacity to harm is lessened .
Some antioxidants of this type are antioxidants , glutatione ubiquinol and uric acid which are produced during the normal metabolism of the body .
Though till now around 9000 antioxidants have been detected .
The most popular antioxidants are Vitamin E , VitaminC and carotenoids .
Tissues of oxygen free radicals  oxygen free radicals  are produced during digestion .
These poisonous molecules of tissues are produced in the body due to the cause of the light of the sun . - ray radiation , food , tobacco or the smoke of car and other pollutants of the atmosphere .
In fact these free radicals harm DNA that is the ones providing hereditary characteristics .
Microbes convert chemical compounds and at times completely destroy the tissues .
With the help of antioxidants the compensation of this damage can be done .
In which way can the antioxidants protect from the harm occurring due to the frss radicals ?
The ones providing immunity are the antioxidants substances .
As it is clear from the name antioxidants are those substances which stop the destruction occurring in the body and normalise the oxidation process occurring in the tissues of the organisms .
These nutritive substance  vitamin and mineral  are enzymes  the supportive protein in the chemical reactions situated in the body  .
It is believed that these protect from the ill effects of the free radicals .
By donating their personal electron the antioxidants depress the process of stealing electron by the free radicals .
After shunning the electron also they do not become free radical because in themselves they have stability .
Antioxidants stop the process of oxidation , by deactivating the free radicals .
In doing such the oxidation of them takes place .
Therefore the sources of antioxidants have to be maintained uninterrupted .
Though you take multivitamin regularly , consume extra VitaminC , many types of fruits , vegetables , then also it is not essential that you are getting sufficient antioxidant .
With respect to these nutritive substances fighting cancer , health enhancer specialists have given opinion .
here such substances are being named which should be taken in daily breakfast .
Among the antioxidants given daily there are VitaminC , vitamin E and selenium .
Vitamin E is found in two types tocopherol and trocotreinol .
If you are taking any vitamin E then it would be tocopherol because at present tocopherol is under research .
What does tocopherol do ?
Tocopherol protects from heart disease , stroke , Alzheimer 's disease and cancer .
The immune capacity also increases with tocopherol .
Trocotreinol fights against heart disease , breast cancer , it also protects the skin from ultraviolet radiations .
Where is tocopherol found ?
In less quantity tocopherol is found in almonds and vegetable oils .
Trocotreinol is found in the husk of rice .
For therapeutic dose the need for other complementary substances arises .
The dose of natural Vitamin E has been suggested in the form of 400 to 800 I . . Of mixed tocopherol .
What does selenium do ?
Selenium protects from cancer , heart disease , cataract , muscular degeneration and is supportive in the function of other antioxidant .
Where is selenium found ?
Selenium is found in brazil nut , cereal , vegetables and its quantity various according to the regional soil .
In the suggested dose 100 to 200 mcg of selenium with food or even without food daily .
Do not take selenium in large quantity otherwise poisoning may occur .
Start taking antioxidants after the age of forty years .
If before the age of 40 years you have to take many pills then you should not take coenzyme Q - 10 alpha lpoic acid .
Coenzyme Q - 10 fights against cancer and heart disease .
Coenzyme Q - 10 makes the gums strong , protects nerves , is helpful in energy production .
Where is coenzyme Q - 10 is found ?
Coenzyme Q - 10 is present in each tissue of body , specially in heart .
Coenzyme Q - 10 is also found in almonds and oils but for medicinal dose extra quantity may be needed to be consumed .
In the suggested dose with daily food 30 mg of coenzyme Q - 10 specially , is important for heart patients .
What does alpha lipoic acid does ?
Alpha lipoic acid protects from the nerve damage related to heart disease , cancer , cataract , stroke , diabetes .
Alpha lipoic acid increases the level of glutathione .
Where is alpha lipoic acid found ?
In some food substances very little quantity of alpha lipoic acid is found  example lettuce , meat , potato etc  .
In the suggested dose 100 mg quantity of alpha lipoic acid with food , 200 mg everyday can be taken by people suffering with diabetes .
What is the sufficient quantity of nutritive substances ?
In 1941 American Food and Nutrition Board decided the quantity of various types of nutritive substances after guessing the quantity of nutritive substances , the protection of body through nutritive substances , through figures after studying the scientific history .
For each type of nutritive substance the board has decided recommended dietary allowance  RDA  which is 98 % diet for healthy people , which the body can easily accept .
Tolerable Upper Intake Level  UL  - is that quantity of nutritive substance which a healthy person can consume everyday without any harm .
Only in some cases the board could not decide yet that how much quantity of nutritive substance would be beneficial or harmful .
How to choose antioxidants for fighting the diseases .
Whenever you buy fruits and vegetables , keep in mind that you choose only those whose color is bright .
As much bright the color of the fruits and vegetables that much more would be the antioxidants .
Apart from this there are more antioxidants in fresh fruits in comparison to canned , cultured or heated food materials .
Generally if you consume food materials with little variation then you get more antioxidants .
Like in comparison to green colored or white colored grapes antioxidants are found more in red grapes .
In comparison to white onion red and yellow onions are more antioxidant rich .
Cauliflower , cabbage raw or light cooked broccoli is highly rich in antioxidants .
In green and grinded garlic much antioxidant is found .
In comparison to canned vegetables fresh and frozen vegetables are richer in antioxidants .
In place of boiled or steam cooked vegetables the vegetables cooked in microwave is richer in antioxidants .
Dark green leafy vegetables are highly rich in antioxidants .
In place of juice whole fruits are rich in antioxidants .
In place of canned juice fresh and cold juice is good source of antioxidant .
Dark orange colored carrot , gourd and sweet potato are substances rich in more antioxidants .
Being scared is also mental disease .
The person suffering from phobia knows that his fear is meaningless and not correct , but then also he is not able to keep control over it .
The disease of being scared has been found more in women .
Generally this problem arises between 20 to 30 years .
Many times this problem gets finished on its own .
In the situation of no treatment it keeps the person disturbed for long time .
having fear or being afraid is one of the many normal emotions .
Fear is in the mind of every person .
No matter how much brave the person is he does become afraid in dangerous situation .

In social phobia not being able to converse by looking straight into the eyes of others .
Panicking while talking to others and feeling lack of confidence .
feeling uneasy in doing special tasks in front of others like - eating , writing etc .
The starting of shivering in voice and limbs while talking to others .
Not able to face the audience after going on the stage .
Due to all these reasons the limiting of the lifestyle of the person are the symptoms of social phobia .
Due to the disease of agoraphobia the person is scared of that situation where going out immediately is difficult .
For example - the fear of getting stuck in crowd , bus , train , lift etc .
In the disease of agoraphobia the person is extremely scared of such places and he stops going to these places .
If by chance also he faces such situations then he starts feeling very scared and helpless .
On the situations becoming serious the symptoms of rapid breathing , cold limbs , shivering , sweating , increase in heart beat , stomach pain , dryness of the mouth etc .
many times the person starts feeling such , as if his life will come out now .
If in such situation the patient is present with any of his dear ones then his fear gets reduced a bit .
Specific phobia is not considered so serious .
In specific phobia much difficulties do not arise in the daily life of the person .
the fear from any specific thing or situation is called specific phobia .
For example the fear more than usual arising out of cockroach , cat , lizard , river , bright light , noise , blood , skyscrapers etc . Come under this category .
The problem of fear in some people also arises due to genetic reasons .
In some people the genes of this disease comes from parents which gives rise to the problem of fear on getting negative environment .
The appearance of the problem of fear in the blood relatives of people suffering from this increases in comparison to general people .
In order to be free from the fears the mind keeps putting it in unconscious mind so that it can feel relaxed after forgetting the worries .
Without any effort the person put his worries in the unconscious mind and feels at peace .
But many times the mind fails to suppress his worries in mind and suffers from the problem of fear .
Those children who become scared more than usual when separated from there mother even for short while , become victim of phobia later on .
Good sleep keeps man fresh mentally and physically .
Apart from this in order to keep other activities of memory and brain function smoothly sufficient sleep is very essential .
People who take less sleep need sleep of 6 hours or less than this everyday .
Even on taking less sleep they do not face any type of problem and they stay absolutely alright mentally and physically .
According to psychologists people who take less sleep are ambitious , cordial and those working more .
People taking more sleep like to sleep every night for 9 hours or more than this .
Even due to sleeping for long there is no ill - effect on their daily activities .
people who sleep long are generally of a little depressed and tensed type .
Socially people who take more sleep are not so cordial .
Maximum people come in the category of persons sleeping for 7 . hours and in them properties of both types are found .
What happens when someone is not allowed to sleep continuously for many days .
Due to not sleeping the person may become victim of irritation and excitement .
Because of not sleeping his concentration power starts reducing .
On not sleeping continuously for 4 . days small bouts of sleep , delusion and the nature of not doing any work starts arising .
Because of not sleeping some people start hearing voices and they may also become the victim of madness .
People suffering from a special type of mental disease  which is also known by the name of bipolar mood disorder  have been seen to become victims of mania  mental rage  due to not taking enough sleep .
What is the problem of not getting sleep ?
The pain of not getting sleep can be understood by him who is suffering from this problem or has already suffered .
The problem of not getting sleep is known by the name of insomnia in medical term .
Almost every fourth person is the victim of insomnia .
The difficulty at the start of sleep - the main symptoms in this are trying hard to sleep , changing sides , to get up to sit , to out to walk , trying again to sleep , but becoming unsuccessful .
The person suffering from worry generally keep becoming the victim of this type of problem .
The sleep comes once but after that it keeps on getting disrupted and the person feels much discomfort .
This problem has been seen arising in the grave condition of depression or worry disease .
Some people do not face any special problem in getting sleep or to maintain it , but their sleep gets disrupted very early in the morning .
Due to this the person starts feeling restless and can not sleep again .
This problem has been seen arising in depression .
Some people only have the misconception of not getting sleep , while they keep taking good sleep .

This problem is also known with the name of  Restless Leg Syndrome  .
The problem of sleeplessness may arise due to any mental or physical illness .
the chief among these are mania , depression , worry disease , schizophrenia , mental tension , heart disease , breathing problem , physical pain like backache , intoxicant consumption .
The other reasons of sleeplessness are related to idiopathic problems connected to sleep , none of whose reasons come to be known .
The problem of sleep in itself comes up as a type of disease .

But generally this problem does not stay for long time .
The disorder of getting more sleep arises in situations like intoxicant consumption , abnormal depression , thyroid disorder , narcolepsy , serious head injury , sleep anima  the obstruction of breathing in sleep  , infection in brain etc .
Doubt is one such psychological state through which every person crosses some time or the other .
The feeling of suspicion has two forms in which one is false suspicion and the other is true suspicion .
False suspicion in which the feeling of doubt subsides after counselling and making aware of the facts .
True suspicion in which after being made aware of the entire facts and truth he stays adamant unnecessarily on his suspicion .
True suspicion arises in serious mental disorders like psychosis , schizophrenia , mania etc .
Paranoid personality Disorder is one such disorder , in which the thought of the person becomes of doubting nature , but by conversation his doubts can be removed to great extent .
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder , in which strong doubts start arising in the mind of the person .
The doubts fail to be removed even after counselling or conversation .
In delusional disorder some special types of strong doubts arise in the mind of the person which on not being treated stay with the person for the entire life .
The life style , working etc of people with delusional disorder stay normal .
The problem of delusional disorder generally starts after the age of 30 years of age .
The feeling of doubt may also arise in people who do intoxication by consuming alcohol , cannabis , chars , marijuana , sleeping pills .
Some medicines used for the treatment of other diseases like steroids , amphetamines , thyroxin , isonaizide etc may also lead to the growth of the feelings of doubt as well .
Mental shock arising suddenly like - death of dear one , loss in business , being fired from job , theft , social disgrace etc leads to the growth of mental disorder named acute psychosis in some people .
In psychosis as well the mind of the person becomes of suspicious type .
In severe situations of other mental diseases like mania , depression , dementia etc also the person may become suspicious .
The nature of the person has also been seen becoming suspicious in physical diseases like AIDS , brain cancer , epileptic disease etc .
Continuously increasing mental tension or the burden of work many times given birth to mental fatigue  neurasthenia  .
Apart from irritation there are many symptoms of this disease .
The other symptoms of neurasthenia disease are feeling tired , energy less body and pain in muscles , headache , sleep disorder and dizziness .
Increase in heartbeat rate , restlessness , numbness of limbs , difficulty in getting sleep , getting bad thoughts in brain are the symptoms of depression .
On this disease becoming serious the person may become victim of irritation .
In the disease of mania  mental excitement  the person starts considering himself better than others and the power of his brain to work starts getting out of control .
the irritation arising due to the reason of mania disorder is the most serious and many times proves very dangerous .
Psychosis  schizophrenia  is a serious mental disease in which the person starts doubting unnecessarily on the people near to him .

The nature of people with proud , asocial and emotionally vulnerable personality etc may be irritable .
Similarly in many other mental conditions and disorders like addiction to intoxicants , delusion and mania , massive changes in life , unfulfillment of desire , lack of sleep , disorder of lack of concentration , mental retardation etc also irritation may arise .
In some physical disorders also suspicious psychology has been seen to be growing .
In general term this disease schizophrenia is also called madness .
but psychiatrists do not consider the use of this word proper for this disease .
In India one person out of hundred in infected with this disease .
some people also consider this as the cancer of mental health .
But the medicines and methods being used in the treatment of this disease have opened new doors to get control on the disease .
The sooner this disease is detected the chances of successful treatment increases that very much .
Any person can become victim of the disease of schizophrenia .
Often this disease grows in the most important stage of life  between 15 to 45 years  .
In the disease of schizophrenia the person starts living in unreal and fictitious world leaving his real life .
In the start of the disease nobody gets to know because initially the symptoms of schizophrenia are very mild .
Like not feeling like working , irritation , little strangeness in the behavior , nagging about small things , occurrence of mild anxiety and sadness etc .
Gradually the symptoms of patient start becoming serious and he starts getting detached from the society .
After sometime the patient of schizophrenia starts paying less attention to hygiene even , like not taking bath for several days , not brushing , not changing clothes etc .
Behaving strangely like talking to oneself , laughing on own self , doing abnormal activity like putting garbage in pockets , cutting clothes by scissors without reason , wandering aimlessly , making gestures in air sitting alone , suddenly removing the clothes without reason , blabbering etc .
Appearance of delusion or doubt as if someone is plotting against patient , other people are doing his backbiting or else anyone has cast spell on him .
Even after umpteen counselling the patient of schizophrenia is adamant on his doubt .
It becomes very difficult to comprehend the speech of patient , because the mutual correlation of things said by him starts getting lost .
On asking one thing the patient of schizophrenia starts telling some other thing .
Giving unclear answer of questions may be one symptom of the disease of schizophrenia .
The patient starts hearing such voices which is audible only to him and not to others .
These are also called ... ... .. . Voices .
the patient of schizophrenia seems scared without reason .
The visibility of distorted shapes is also the symptom of schizophrenia .
The other symptoms of schizophrenia are to stay quiet , not feeling happy or sad at any matter or else staying happy without reason , getting angry without reason , fighting or breaking things , standing at a place for hours without caring for sun light or rain , dancing or singing without reason .
The patient feeling such as if the newspaper , TV and radio people are publishing news about him or else telling his thoughts to everyone .
Keep in mind that it is not essential that all these symptoms should be present in one patient .
In various patients the symptoms of this disease may be different .
Till now the actual reasons of the disease of schizophrenia has not been known accurately , but some understood reasons are this way .
Hereditary reason - if any of mother - father have the disease then it can go to the child through genes .
the chance of this disease in the blood relatives of the patient increases slightly in comparison to others .
Some chromosomes like 5 , 11 , 18 , 19 and X have been found to be related to this disease .
The chemical change in the brain - the error in dopamine , serotonin and other chemicals of the brain in some parts of the brain may become reason of this disease .
the medicine given for the treatment of this disease corrects this error thereby getting control over it .
Mental tension more than necessary may also give rise to the disease of schizophrenia .
On the increase of tension those people become the victims of the disease who already from before have the possibility of the occurrence of this within .
Often in India schizophrenia disease is considered to be the effect of magic , eternal rage or evil spirit .
Due to which reason the patient is first taken to the black magicians and absurd treatment is done .
Due to this reason right treatment is not received on time and the condition of the patient becomes serious .
Schizophrenia has also taken into its capture great personalities , artists and scientists .
After being inflicted by the disease of schizophrenia he had to leave his job .
But with the help of his wife and continuous treatment Nash became healthy enough and was successful in getting his job .
Mania is one such psychological disorder in which the person goes into the state of euphoria .
Mania disease is the inverse of depression .
In depression where the person becomes sad , lethargic and weak there in mania he starts staying excited more than usual .
Every person 's mood keeps changing with time .
Like at times he stays happy and at times sad .
The change of mood is a normal experience .
But when this mood starts staying happy or sad more than required and starts putting bad impact on the normal life of the person then it is the sign of psychological disorders like mania or depression .
Mania disease can occur both in men and women .
Children have also been seen becoming victim of mania .
Around one out of hundred people is inflicted with mania .
The main symptom of mania disease is staying excited and happy more than required .
Every time staying angry and in rage .
The onset of chain of thoughts in the brain .
The patient feeling such as if from all the four sides many ideas are unfolding and coming .
Speaking and laughing more than necessary .
Talking to strangers meaninglessly .
Talking big and considering oneself better and more powerful than the others .
Making big plans which are beyond the capacity of the person .
Suddenly more interest arising in social , political and religious affairs .
Ordering other people uselessly and on whose unfulfillment arguing and getting angry .
Lack of sleep , the patient feeling himself fresh even after sleeping one or two hours in the entire day .
Extravagance and useless shopping .
Becoming adamant more than required .
Not accepting and arguing after counselling by others .
Quarrelling and fighting over small things .
Growth of restlessness , not able to concentrate at one place .
Wearing fancy clothes , doing new fashion , considering oneself like hero or heroine .
Rejection from accepting that he has any psychological disease .
Increase in sexual desires .
In serious condition the patient starts ignoring his appearance , diet and body as well .
In some patients doubt and delusion also arise .
If the treatment of this condition is not done then this stage of mania may continue to stay generally for 4 to 5 months .
Once on the occurrence of the disease of mania there is always a risk of its occurrence in the future  especially , if proper treatment is not done  .
After the state of mania is corrected some patients continue to suffer with the feeling of self pity and crime .
Many times depression and mania start appearing in one patient only .
Once the patient suffers from mania and second time from depression .
This type of mental disorder is also known by the name of swing  maniac depressive disorder  or bipolar disorder .
In India the patient suffering with mania continues to suffer from this disease for long time .
On not getting the right treatment many types of problems like heavy loss in business , disharmony in mutual relations , legal problems , argument with fellow workers and officers , family problems etc . surround such people badly .
Can the attack of mania come again ?
Yes of course , the attack of mania can come again in the life of the person suffering from mania .
In the situation of no treatment many attacks can come second time in the life of the person suffering with mania .
The attacks occurring in the future may also be of depression .
After how long second attacks would come or else how serious they would be it is slightly difficult to say all these for certain .
But it has been seen that , as the age increases the attacks also start occurring frequently and their seriousness also go on increasing .
Through proper treatment the occurrence of the attack of mania can be stopped .
Some conditions related to the disease of mania are mix type , rapid cycler , ultra rapid cycler .
In the person suffering with mix type disorder the symptoms of depression and mania are present simultaneously .
For example on one hand the person is working with great pace and enthusiasm , but inside his view towards life would be negative .
In rapid cycler disorder the person starts becoming the victim of mania or depression at least four times within a year .
In the ultra rapid cycler disorder the symptoms of depression and mania keep changing fast among themselves at the interval of some hours or days .
The ultra rapid cycler patient starts feeling sad after staying unusually in happiness for some hours .
This sadness of ultra rapid cycler patient starts changing fast again after some time .
This is thing of surprise that the mood of person also can be the victim of disease .
The patient suffering with ultra rapid cycler at times starts becoming sad in the form of depression and at times uncontrollably happy in the state of mania .
The loss of mental capacity occurring in the old age  more than 60 years  due to which excessive reduction starts coming in the memory , intelligence , prudence , the capacity to learn new and the capability to adjust according to new situations of the person .
All these symptoms are the signal of the disorder of dementia  psychological delusion  .
Although with increase in age reduction starts coming in the mental and physical capacity of every person .
This reduction does not produce any major difficulty in the normal life of the person .
For example if 65 year old person at times forgets the name of any relative or an object after keeping it somewhere , then it is not essential that this problem is the signal of disease .
On putting some pressure he even remembers those situations again .
But the patient of the dieses of dementia starts forgetting more than required and losses the ability to remember again .
In dementia the person is forced to behave like children .
The child though with age develops his mental capabilities , but the condition of the patient suffering with the disease of dementia becomes serious with increase in age .
there are two reasons for the dementia disease .
The first reason is the contraction of brain .
This happens due to the disease named Alzheimer .
In Alzheimer due to the death of the cells of brain the size of the brain starts decreasing .
Together with this the chemical named acetilcolinesterase also starts decreasing in brain .
The second reason is the accumulation of the clots in the transmitters of blood providing nutrition to brain .
In India among all the reasons of dementia this is a major reason .
The symptoms of the disease do dementia are as follows .
Lack of memory , difficulty in remembering new things .
Arising of problems in remembering date , telephone number and the account of money .
Gradually forgetting old things .
In dementia produced due to the disease named Alzheimer the loss of memory takes place very slowly about which many times for up to several years there is no knowledge .
Loss in the awareness of place and time for example considering morning as evening , to start using kitchen as bathroom , forgetting the way to home etc .
Forgetting the names of things found nearby like on showing the spectacles not able to say what it is .
Purchasing unnecessary things from market .
Changes in personality like staying silent more than required or else the growth of very irritable or doubting nature .
Such symptoms are seen in 30 percent patients of dementia .
Repeating one thing repeatedly , talking nonsense , cracking joke untimely , putting on clothes weirdly , keeping things here and there .
Reduction in the ability to do fundamental things like bathing , wearing clothes , eating etc .
Losing control on oneself suddenly .
Becoming restless , shouting and fighting in anger .
Shitting in clothes or even in open .
Such often occurs in the last stages of dementia disease .
Difficulty in speaking , dizziness , loss of weight , difficulty in sleep etc symptoms also may arise in dementia disease .
All these symptoms should be present in a patient together such is not essential .
Every patient of dementia may have his own different symptoms .
If this disease is due to the reason of the disease named Alzheimer then the death of patient occurs between 1 to 20 years .
On the occurrence of this disease before 50 years its more serious form comes forward .
The ex president of America Ronald Reagan had also become the Vitim of this disease only .
In the film Black Amitabh Bachchan has been shown to be suffering from this disease only .
God knows how many women and girls due to not being able to express straight the complexes of the mind , suppressed desires , problems and difficulties exhibit in the form of hysteria .
Even after tiring to know intensely , many times it becomes difficult to know the matters on their mind and this problem goes on continuing for long time .
In one way the problem of hysteria is the voice of the mind .
Generally the meaning of hysteria is considered in the form of the onset of bots of unconsciousness .
But there are many types of hysteria .
Due to ignorance this myth is popular pervasively that this disease occurs due to the effect of various supernatural powers , ghost , spirits , souls of dead etc .
Actually hysteria disease occurs due to the reason of the problems happening at the mental level .
In India hysteria disease is found more in married women .
the disease of hysteria is found in children from 5 years to even men .
The chance of the occurrence of the disease of hysteria is the maximum between the age of 10 up to 30 years .
In psychiatry hysteria is known by the name of dissociative disorder .
The symptoms of the disease of hysteria are as follows .
Occurrence of seizures - in this various types of symptoms can occur together or separately .
Like breathing rapidly or with difficulty , throwing limbs here and there in air , staying unconscious for many hours , tightening of fist , the pupils continuing to move after the closing of eyes etc .
The seizures of hysteria are different from the seizures of epilepsy .
Theatrical hysteria - in this the patient conducts as if in him there is the residing of any god , spirit or ghost and the powers of giving boon or punishment have come in him .
That time the voice of the patient also changes .
Big crowd of audience get surrounded near him and people ask for favors from him .
Paralysis - in this the condition of weakness appears in one or more organs like in hand , foot , shoulders etc .
Whose relation is not with any physical deformity or disease even .
At times there is such feeling as if the body organ has stopped working .
Many times for doctor also differentiating between actual paralysis and hysterical paralysis becomes difficult .
Dumbness and noiselessness - in these conditions the patient is not able to speak anything .
But without any problem he can whisper , can do his talking by writing or gesturing through hands .
On investigation all the organs of the patient of hysteria like the tongue , lips , sound cord etc are found to be working in normal way .
Why does hysteria arise ?
The mind complicated by some problem when fails to find any solution then the situation of a mental conflict arises .
In such situation if any person is not able to face his mental strife or is not able to express his problem in any way then the suffering mind finds the way to escape from his problems or to express them through hysteria .
Often women due to social and domestic situations are not able to express their desires and feelings and consequently many types of internal conflict arise in their mind .
These conflicts continuing in the sub - conscious mind become the reason of hysteria .
Hysteria is completely the game of sub - conscious mind .
The addiction of intoxication is also the disease of mind .
The biggest problem is this that those people who do intoxication they themselves do not know whether they are the victim of addiction or not .
One person who takes eight - ten pegs of alcohol only four or five times in a month he assumes that the addiction of alcohol has occurred to him .
On the other hand that person who takes half bottle of alcohol every night and can not sleep without drinking , says to himself that no - no I am not drunkard , drunkards are of different kind altogether .
I drink only some , that also while sleeping .
The person does the intoxication of anything and to him any of the three things out of six things given underneath apply to him then assume that he has been addicted or used to for intoxication .
Intense desire to take intoxicating substance .
Repeatedly failing in the attempts to quit intoxication .
Arising of physical and mental problems on the unavailability of intoxication  like the shivering of limbs on not getting alcohol , not getting sleep or getting restless  .
Gradual increase in the quantity of intoxication  because after some time the effect of the previous quantity starts reducing  .
For example the person doing smack intoxication in some months from half gram smack his coming to two gram smack .
Wasting a lot of time in the consumption of intoxicating substances .
The person ignoring the other aspects of his life like socializing , doing his work , care of the children etc .
Intoxication is harming the body , despite knowing this continuing intoxication .
For example despite jaundice and vomiting blood not stopping the consumption of alcohol .
Apart from this other symptoms like intoxication in solitude , harm to the physical and mental health , taking intoxication in large quantity in one go etc are also the signals of the problem of intoxication .
Beer , whisky , champagne , vodka , rum , gin , brandy , alcohol , country made alcohol etc come in the category of alcohol .
In the category of tobacco bidi , cigarette , cigar , tobacco powder etc .
Canabis - charas , marijuana , sulpha , hashish all these substances are obtained from the plant of canabis  hemp  .
Sleeping pills like - diazepam , nitrozapam , alprazola  alprex  etc .
Opium related substance - opium , smack , brown sugar , capsules proxivon and spasmovon , the pills of lomotil etc .
Other substances - amphitamin . . . . Solvent  petrol , eraser fluid , polish etc  cocaine , tea , coffee etc .
Tea , coffee are also in fact intoxicating substances , but due to not being much harmful they have been accepted on the social basis .
Being mentally or physically dependent on substances affecting the activities of body and brain is only called the addiction of intoxication .
The addiction of intoxication has been considered a mental disorder .
The Indians alone drink approximately 120 crore litre of alcohol during a year .
The consumption of alcohol in India is continuously gaining strength .
If the drunkard is able to quit alcohol foursome months then it is good riddance , because during this his body and liver gain strength as earlier .
But if the liver has become absolutely bad then even after quitting alcohol it does not become alright .
For the patient it is very difficult to quit alcohol on his own is very difficult .
for this a lot of will power is needed which is formed in very few people .
Some people think that by gradually reducing the quantity of alcohol one day I will completely quit it in fact such people deceive themselves .
Like this it is nearly impossible to quit the addiction of alcohol .
In order to get rid of this problem it is extremely important to take the advice of the psychiatrist .
People in whom there is no internal desire to quit alcohol , their family members should certainly meet their closest psychiatrist once .
many times the work appearing difficult is in fact easy .
Through some methods in such addicted people producing the internal desire to quit drinking may be tried .
To treat addiction two method are used one is through medicines and second through behavioural treatment .
In the treatment through medicines some special medicines are started after completely stopping the alcohol of the patient .
After some days of this the patient and his family members are told about two different types of medicines .
One medicine helps in reducing the addiction of alcohol while the second medicine produces negative effect as the alcohol is consumed .
Due to this medicine reddening of the face , vomiting , breathlessness , restlessness , giddiness , fainting etc occur .
Due to the fear of these negative effects the person stops consuming alcohol .
In the behavioural treatment talking with patient , counselling , relaxation , exercise , desensitization , aversion therapy , group therapy etc are included .
Along with medicines behavioural treatment also has very important contribution in treatment .
No matter what the addiction is , after getting the treatment 60 - 70 percent people again start the intoxication within few months .
In such situation the patient and his family members should meet with his doctor again without feeling sad .
Today the main aim for the treatment of intoxication of the psychiatrists world over is to keep the person addiction free for long time after successful treatment .
If the person drinking alcohol more than required is not ready to stop alcohol completely or else is unsuccessful in doing this , then the consumption of alcohol in controlled way may be one way of treatment .
This method is determined after talking to the doctor .
Abstain from the quacks advertising the medicines for quitting alcohol without telling .
Never ever make the patient consume any such medicine , because due to these medicines if the patient consumes alcohol then due to negative effect  reaction  the patient may even die due to this .
Keep in mind that addiction also is the disease of mind only .
Other diseases like running nose , cold , cough may occur again similarly the addiction to intoxication may also occur again .
Therefore do not panic , take stem for repeated treatment .
Apart from the addiction of intoxication the addicted person may also become the victim of other mental problems like worry , depression , fear , suicide etc .
After leaving any intoxication its desire  the intense desire to do intoxication  troubles the person for some days .
This way after gaining control the desire to do intoxication dies gradually .
After the treatment the doubt of the family members on the behavior and conduct of the patient becomes the cause of complex for the patient .
Due to this in anger he can start the intoxication again .
Therefore the family members not making the environment of apprehension , should increase mutual co - ordination and trust with the patient , so that on doing intoxication again he himself tells about it .
The consumption of these pills is not any serious subject till the time its consumption is done according to the advice of the doctor .
The intoxication of tobacco is also like e mental disease just like other intoxications whose treatment is possible .
Among the cancer occurring to Indians 40 percent cancer is due to the reason of tobacco .
Every year due to the reason of smoking 8,00,000 people die .
At the time of quitting intoxication the desire produced for intoxication troubles maximum to the person at the time of quitting intoxication .
Once after the production of the desire of intoxication it stays for nearly 3 to 5 minutes .
To gain control over these desire of intoxication is little difficult , but not impossible .
After quitting the intoxication of tobacco it is natural process for the increase of 2 . kilograms in the weight of the person .
On the increase of weight there is no need for any panic .
In the entire world nearly 400 million  40 crore  people are suffering with mental problems .
Not just this , among 10 chief diseases of the world making man incapable 5 are of psychological type .
Seeing these facts the W . .  World Health Organisation  started introducing huge missions against these diseases in 2001 .
In India every year nearly one lac ten thousand people are becoming victims of suicide .
The deaths occurring due to the reason of suicide is one of the ten main causes of deaths in entire India .
Every year in the entire world nearly 10 lac people end their life by their own hands .
In India every minute one failed attempt of suicide and every fifth minute one painful incident of suicide occurs .
In the cases of suicide India is at second position after China in the whole world .
Today the advertisement of reiki , naturopathy , touch therapy etc is being done with great vigor .
Any person who does not know even this as to how does the human brain work , starts treating with the help of these techniques that he has the successful treatment of worry , depression and mental tension etc .
Abstain from such ignorant doctors , these methods may not necessarily be wrong , in the treatment of psychological disorders these techniques have chiefly proved to be unsuccessful .
In the initial stages of the disease of depression there is condition of mild mental tension and these methods show slight influence , then also it is considered to be the certified method of the correct treatment of mental diseases .
In the disease of muscular rheumatism the symproms of pain in muscles etc symptoms are found .
The other symptoms of muscular rheumatism disease are back ache , chest pain , pain in neck and stiffness of neck .

At times the accumulation of toxins in rectum or intestines , becomes reason of this .
In muscular rheumatism pain regularly stays in muscles .
This pain increases when the organ in which the patient has pain , brings that in use .

If you have little - bit of common sense , and little - bit of perseverance then you do not know how much happy you can make yourself on this planet .
Through these words of Saumerset Maughm it becomes clear as to how important is the place of laughter in life .
Actually the person who does not have any place of amusement in his life he does not have to make any effort for becoming sad .
Without making any effort he can stay sad uninterrupted daily .
The smile of a second or one good laugh is capable of changing the direction of life .
According to Bacon the jovial nature of person is the best means of longevity .
Tagore says whenever I laugh then the burden of my mind is lightened .
The secret of the popularity of Gandhiji was his love for fun .
Gandhiji writes laugh unties the knots of mind very easily .
Not of my mind alone but of your mind a well .
Laugh is one simple - natural process , but it is an amazing process .
This is one basic nature which is found only in humans .
It is said that person devoid of literature , music and art is like animal .
This thing is right to some extent but if seen on behavioural level then the person who does not use this gift of laughter endowed to man by nature then he is the biggest animal .
Human body is like a laboratory in which every moment biochemical and electromagnetic changes continue taking place .
As a result of these various changes man gets the feeling of happiness and pain .
Mind has deciding role in this .
According to our psychological state the bio - chemical structure of our body is only affected .
Optimistic psychological state has positive and negative psychological state has negative impact on the bio - chemical structure of our body .
Laughing is one such process which puts only positive effect on human body because in the process of laughing the role of mind becomes null or negligible .
The person laughing reaches to the state of no state that5 very moment which is the state of meditation only .
When you laugh then in those moments you reach to the state of deep thought or meditation on your own because at one time only laughing and meditation becomes impossible .
The meaning of laughter is to produce obstruction in thought process .
If you really laugh in reality then the thought process whether it is positive or negative stops immediately because at one time you do only one thing holistically .
Because of our incomplete activities our life becomes haphazard and imbalanced .
Therefore whatever action you do that in complete attention .
In laughter especially in the state of laughing heartily one is able to control the restlessness of the mind no matter if it is momentary .
That momentary control over the restlessness of the mind is an incredible incident .
For man it is beneficial situation for his good health .
Laughter is in fact a condition of instant yoga .
The more the recurrence of these moments that much we will go near the yoga rich life .
By laughing the benefit of exercise is also obtained .
By laughing forcefully the breathing process is also affected .
Therefore the practice of both yogasana and pranayam occurs in the action of laughter .
Due to laughing because of the consumption of extra calories one gets help in controlling the weight .
Due to laughing because of the increase in blood circulation freshness appears in the body especially the muscles of the face .
Yoga is a complete treatment methodology .
Laughter is also not less than any type of yoga therefore through laughter the medical treatment is related to laughter .
After yoga practice and other physical activities and aerobics and athletics etc the practice of laughter is also done .
After sports and mental labor the tiredness of body relieved with laughter and one more freshness comes in the body .
Not only in sports but in the matter of personality development and during motivational workshops as well the inclusion of laughter is must because after a good laugh the attention of the person becomes more concentrated and becomes centred on the subject again .
In everything literature , culture and art laughter is certainly present in some or the other form otherwise reader or subscriber would not be able to establish harmony .
Laughter is a complete exercise in which all the nerves of the body open and the body becomes fresh after the tiredness of the body is removed .
By laughing openly good exercise of lungs , throat and mouth occurs .
The nerves of stomach and chest become strong .
The diaphragm becomes strong and by this one gets help in the treatment of the diseases related to mouth , throat and lungs .
By laughter the rate of blood flow becomes fast because of which the quantity of oxygen in the blood increases .
In this entire process glow comes on the face .
The more one laughs and makes the other laugh that much more his face would glow .
The more the absorption of oxygen in the body that much more energy would be produced and as much energy is produced that much we will stay disease free .
This way laughter is the healing and nutritive element of life and it may also be called the essence of life .
Through laughter changes come in the bio - chemical construction of our body .
Due to laughter reduction comes in the level of hormones producing tension namely cortisone and epinephrine because of which the body becomes tension free and the meaning of tension free is health .
Apart from this due to laughter the quantity of hormone named endorphin increase which is a natural painkiller and works as disease immunity for the body .
According to the research of Dr . Lee Berk of Rosalinda University of California T . Lymphocytes stay more active because of laughing and staying happy because of which there is increase in the growth of those natural cells which are called killer cells .
These killer cells are capable of destroying those dangerous cells capable of the growth of cancer .
This way by laughing one gets help in getting rid of dangerous diseases .

With laughter exercise you can say good bye to old age forever .
Laughter is a spiritual health , laughter is burden less .
When you laugh then you can keep your mind separate .
The person who can not laugh for him the door of intellect is closed .
For me the importance of laughter is high .
Any religion has not thought of laughter ever .
Religion has always emphasized on seriousness and therefore all the world went on becoming sick psychologically .
Seriousness is a mental state produced from negative pont of view while laughter is a state obtained from positive point of view .
Through laughter throw away the coat of negative point of view or seriousness forever .
Leave making excuses and smile a little .
After this laugh and laugh strongly .
This only is the invaluable essence of life and the art of living the life with enthusiasm .

Why do we yawn ?
According to Dr . . Balasubramaniam there are many things in the daily life which are considered common but we do not have any explanation of these with us .
Yawning is one such thing .
If I see you yawning then why do I also start yawning ?
Why is yawning like an infection ?
Why do we start yawning a little time before going top bed and immediately after getting up ?
Together with yawning why do we stretch ?
Someone had said that yawning is like economics regarding which everyone has his one favorite explanation .
A very popular belief is this that we yawn then when we need more oxygen .
But it has been found that this belief about yawning is not correct .
Dr . Robert Provin of Maryland University is doing research on yawnings for long time .
Dr . Robert Provin made some people sit in the room and kept on changing the composition of air .
At first he made the volume of carbon dioxide 3 . percent in the room and observed the rate of yawning in people .
After this he made the volume of carbon dioxide zero percent and once more the rate of yawnings were seen .
It has been seen that both the times the rate of yawnings  dimension  has been nearly equal .
Do we take more yawnings when we are tired ?
No difference has been seen in the dimension of yawnings before the exercise , during and afterwards .
Does yawning have any relation with age ?
It has been found that new born baby and even the foetus yawn .
During ultrasound inspection yawnings have been recorded in twenty weeks pregnancy .
It seems that this action is approximately as important as respiration , movement of eyes and parturition during birth .
This is an involuntary action on which the person does not have any control .
Yawning is not a simple action .
On average yawning is of 6 to 7 seconds .
During yawning the air is inhaled till deep and then released all of a sudden .
During yawning the heartbeat rate increases up to 30 percent and many types of nervous scientific changes occur in the brain .
It seems that the relation of yawning is to the attentiveness of waking up .
By this one understands as to why long spells of yawning comes to people suffering from nervous scientific problems  epilepsy , multiple sclerosis  .
It can be that yawning also does the work of a psychological pressure - release .
It is clear that yawning is not just the symbolism of boredom , sadness and the lack of oxygen alone .
On the basis of the nature of the disease , the availability of the related medicine and its process of effect the doctor prescribes the patient to take pills , injection and syrup according to the need .
Maximum medicines are available in all the three forms of pills , syrup  solution  , injection .
Then also there are many such allopathic medicines which are available in one form only .
Keeping the condition of the patient , age , condition of the disease and the effect of the medicine in sight the medicine is made to reach the body through the following media .
Through the mouth the medicine is given in the form of tablet  pill  , capsule , syrup  solution  .
The cover of capsule is made of gelatine which melts after going to the gall bladder .
With the name of medicines which are to be drunk you often read linctuses , mixture , emulsion .
From linctus the meaning is of that medicine which generally is in sweet solution .
Mixture is the solution of many medicines in water or in other chemicals .
In emulsion there are two solvents which generally becomes negligible .
The medicine of heart disease is placed on the tongue , which shows effect immediately by melting gradually .
This medium of taking the medicine is called ' sub lingual ' medium .
Injection and allopathic treatment have become the synonym of each other .
For giving glucose and other medicine fast into the body injection is given intravenous that is through the medium of arteries .
The veins visible on the outer part of the body take the deoxygenated blood towards the heart .
Opposite to this the arteries situated in the deeper parts of the body take the blood to the rest of the body from the heart .
In the arteries this blood flows with the speed of 65 kilometre per hour .
Then only the arteries are heard to be beating fast .
In general terms it only is called ' pulse ' .
the second popular medium of giving injection is ' intramuscular ' that is giving injection in the muscles .
Generally injection is put on the upper or outer part of the arm or the upper part of the hips only .
Actually in both these places the nerves beneath the flesh is less .
If any nerve gets damaged through the needle of the injection then it can be lethal for the patient .
Apart from these popular methods there are ' subcutaneous ' and ' intradermal ' methods as well .
In these methods instead of putting the injection deeply in the flesh it is put at low depth beneath the skin .
The ' turbutaline ' injection in respiratory disease and ' insulin ' injection of diabetes is put through this method only .
In the subcutaneous method the effect of the medicine is slow .
Apart from this injection is also put in stomach  peritoneal  . In chect  pectoral  and spinal cord  spinal  .
In the diseases like asthma and cough the patient takes in some medicine by inhaling through breathing .
The medicine to make unconscious during surgery  ether  is also given through this medium alone .
In the medium of local application ointment , balm , oil etc are applied in body pain , warts , injury , itching atc on the essential places .
The ointment applied on the nose , ear and eyes and glycerine etc applied on mouth ulcers also come under this category alone .
How does the medicine show its effect ?
The medicines given through the injection enter the blood flow directly only .
Therefore the effect also is quick and pervasive .
The medicines taken through mouth digest with the food in gall bladder and intestines .
The intestines fail to absorb these medicines completely .
If they stomach is empty then the oral medicines show more effect .
The medicine absorbed through the intestines goes to the liver through the ' postal vessel ' .
If the functioning of the liver is not alright then maximum medicines become inactive .
various types of enzymes affect the chemical activities of the medicines .
From the liver the medicine goes to the heart and from there through the pumping action it sends the blood to every cell of the body .
The medicine travels in the entire body through the plasma available in the blood .
These medicines finally mix with the fluid available outside the cell and show their effect wherever there is need of medicines .
After the consumption the remaining medicine is excreted through the urine after reaching the kidney from the heart through the medium of the excretory parts of the cells .
Therefore during the excretion of some medicines the color of the urine appears to be yellow , red or dark .
Which medicine stays in the body for how long and for how long it affects , on this basis alone the doctor prescribes the mode of taking the medicine to the patient .
Even after scholarly studies and researches the exact theory of the effect of the medicine has not been developed .
Receptor Theory ' proceeds by considering this that along with special tissues there is a construction named receptor in the body which attaches to and then speeds up as the medicine comes close to the tissue .
The second theory is of ' antimetaolitis ' , according to which the cells acquire their nutrition from special type of elements .
The antibacterial medicines too possess the shape of nutritive elements .
As such the microbes etc consider these as nutrition and their growth stops .
Finally the microbes die and the patient become alright .
Enzymes are those elements , which are helpful in fastening the various chemical activities in the body .
Some enzymes do the work of ferrying the liquid inside and outside of the cells .
Some medicines are capable of affecting the general nature of these enzymes and the functioning cells .
Allopathic medicines are made of various types of plants , minerals , chemicals and the body of animals .
These medicines show effect according to the nature of the specific disease .
Some medicines fulfil the deficiency of special elements in the body while some deactivate the chemicals which have increased .
Similarly some medicines provide speed to the activities of the body while some finish off the growing microbes .
Due to this reason alone the side effects  ill effects  of English medicine is also very much .
Not sleep , the base of the entire health is yoganidra .
As it is clear from the name alone , the attainment of the condition of sleep through yoga only is yoganidra .
What is yoga ?
The control over the activities of will or mind alone is yoga .
Handicappedness is an extremely ancient and omnipresenet problem .
The people of all the parts , religions and communities of the world get affected with handicappedness more or less .
Everyone male - female , rich - poor can be the victim of handicappedness .
With time change has come in the appearance of this problem of handicappedness .
Today control has been achieved to very great extent on measles , reasons of blindness at birth , leprosy , polio etc .
The cases of cerebral palsy and mental retardation are increasing .
The spread of education in handicaps is also increasing and the understanding of people towards handicappedness is also becoming positive .
Technical development has provided artificial reading power to blind people , better hearing power to deaf people , improved movement to skeletally handicapped people .
The development of medical science has prevented the growth of diseases and put reins on the process of conversion of diseases on handicappedness .
The spreading of education among handicapped people is increasing due to the efforts of Indian government , state governments and self help organizations .
Today the situation has come to this that by providing suitable environment and extra facilities the handicapped people can be included in the mainstream of society .
By providing obstruction free environment we can provide them with opportunity to become respected citizens .
Now instead of becoming burden on the society the handicapped people may come in the condition of contributing to the society .
Computer , information technology , automation have made working for handicapped people very simple .
Now in comparison to normal people handicapped people may contribute better .
The weakening of any part of body , situation arising due to deformation is called handicappedness .
Before understanding handicappedness well it is essential to understand the various organs and their working .
The ability of sight plays important role in our life .
Most of our activities are possible because of our reason of seeing .
The various types of deformities occuring in eyes become the reason of vision imparement .
How much is the vision impairement this a specialist doctor can tell only after complete check up but there is also an easy method of testing it .
If a person is not able to count the fingers of a person standing at the distance of three metres then he can be considered visually impaired .
The complete investigation of visually impaired person is essential .
A big part of the eye ball is white .
This white part maintains the shape of the eye and also protects its fragile construction .
A small part exists in front of the eye which is called cornea and it works as a window .
Light enters through the medium of cornea .
Hearing impairment is that condition in which child or adult is incapable of hearing partially or in complete form .
There are many types of hearing impairment .
Many times outer and middle ear fail to transmit sound to the inner ear .
In such situation the person faces difficulty in hearing .
One more reason for this can be this that dirt gets accumulated in the canal of the ear .
Apart from this deformity in the construction of the bones of the ear , injury or because of the reason of any disease also it can happen .
The reason of other type of deafness can be the deformity in the inner ear .
The more the deformity , more is the loss of hearing ability .
In the innere ear place is decided for every frequency .
In the inner ear the loss at any frequency becomes less and on some it becomes extremely high .
There are many reasons of this type of deformity but generally due to the reason of damage of the minute construction of cochlea this deformity takes birth .
In some children due to the damage occuring in cochlea the ability to bear loud noise gets destroyed .
The more the damage becomes the ability of child to recognize words become that much less .
When the damage occurred in the cochlea it does not get corrected through treatment and surgery then there is no other way leaft apart from wearing the hearing aid .
If the pregnant woman suffers from from viral fever , influenza , chicken pox , mumps etc in the first trimester then the child in the womb can be adversely affected .
The child in the womb can also become deaf .
In childhood diseases like meningitis , jaundice , typhoid , measles can put adverse effect on the hearing ability of the person .
The complications during birth like foreceps delivery can have influence on the ear .
Continuous flow of water and pus may also become the reason of becoming deaf .
If the pregnant woman eats unnecessary medicine without the consult of the doctor for abortion or any disease then there could be adverse effect on the foetus and it may also become deaf .
There are two ways of safety from deafness .
First way is this that one should stay away from those diseases which give birth to deafness .
Second this that if there has been the influence of this disease then it should be prevented from being converted to handicappedness .
The useful instrument used for hearing in deaf people is basically a small electronic appliance .
This electronic appliance is also called a minute mike .
Through this electronic appliance or minute mike the sound can be amplified many times .
Speaking is actually a special process which differentiates us from other organisms .
If by 15 months the child is not able to speak meaningful word then it is essential to get him tested .
If by this age the child starts speaking words like mummie , papa then there is no reason to worry .
If the voice of the child is abnormal , heavier , or comes with obstruction then also it is essential to get it c hecked up .
During management program the exercises for the growth of child is being done .
During management plan the activities of daily life are taught .
The child is taught to speak , move etc under the management plan .
Under this the difficulties of the children are solved and the treatment of the diseases are also done .
Some activities among these take place in hospital or rehabilitation center and some take place at home alone .
The activities which take place at home are demonstrated to the mother - father and important instructions are given to be repeated at home .
According to the American Association of Mental Retardation that person is called mentally retarded who is not able to do his simple activity .
The measurement of intelligence is less than 70 and bothe these problems start affecting the person from the age of 18 years only .
From 0 . years the child learns to stand up , walk , run , eat , wear clothes , use toilet , keep clean , to converse etc .
From 6 years to 12 years of age the child learns to read - write , talk meaningfully , to help etc .
From 12 to 18 years of agethe child learns to do all his domestic work and lears to use hospital , post - office , public vehicle , phone etc .
The child acquires skill in sports and entertaining activities as well .
the child learns to do useful work as well .
That child whose growth rate is less than the above mentioned rate he is considered to be mentally retarded .
Intelligence measurement scale is a method to measure intelligence prepared by the scientists .
The average IQ of man is from 90 to 110 .
If the IQ is between 70 to 89 then the man can lead satisfactory life .
If the IQ is less than 70 then the man is considered to be mentally retarded .
On the IQ being less than 70 it becomes essential to pay attention to him .
If the IQ is between 52 to 69 then the man is considered to be less mentally retarded .
The man with IQ between 36 to 51 is considered to be average mentally retarded .
If the IQ is between 20 to 35 then he is considered to be extremely mentally retarded .
The people with IQ less than 19 are considered to be extremely serious .
Making a mentally retarded child recognize himself and learn his own name is an art in itself .
For this during all the activities of the mentally retarded child like bathing , changing clothes , eating , playing etc . his name should be called .
Apart from this after showing the reflection of the child in mirror his name should be called out so that he can recognize himself .
For making the mentally retarded child learn to drink milk at first he is made to sit in front of the mirror and shown to hold the glass .
The child becomes happy by seeing himself in the mirror drinking milk .
Initially the child has to be given support but later on the child the child starts drinking on his own .
People who are mentally ill are entirely different from mentally retartded people .
The IQ of the person mentally ill is average or more than average .
The growth of the person mentally ill also takes place normally .
These people are victims of the psychological disorder and become alright through medicine or psychological treatment .
Due to psychological disorder their feelings become deformed and along with it effect is seen on the intelligence as well .
The persons mentally ill generally become alright after treatment and lead normal life at home .
Those people who do not get alright and do dangerous activities , they are kept at mental hospitals .
If the hands of the person are incapable then he would considered to be the victim of the impairement of the upper skeleton .
If the legs are incapable then he would be considered to be the victim of impairement of lower skeletan .
There are many reasons of skeletal impairment and some among these start from pregnancy itself .
Many diseases occurring to the pregnant mother become the cause of handicapedness in the child in the womb .
Many times from the time of birth the hands or feet of the child remain underdeveloped or are not there at all .
In such situation the person does maximum work with the help of assisting instruments or artificial organs .
Many times the loss of hands can be fulfilled with legs and the loss of legs with hands .
The legs of many children are twisted and deformed from birth .
Attempt should be made to straighten such deformed feet as soon as possible because the bones and joints of children are soft .
Cerebral palsy is one of the deformities occurring from birth and is sufficiently dangerous .
Due to the damage occurring in the brain some organs of the brain stop functioning .
Jaundice is a major reason of cerebral palsy .
In the state of jaundice one can be saved from this situation by giving blood to the child as soon as possible .
High fever , vommitting etc occurring in new born baby become the causes of cerebral palsy .
Apart from this many children become victims of T . .
The condition of cerebral palsy persists life long because there is no treatment for this .
But on the other side if correct opportunities are provided to the suffering child then to sufficient extent he can become responsible and a man of independent personality .
In the management of child suffering with cerebral palsy the role of parents and guardian is important .
Therefore for preparing parents for this work continuous consult and support should be given .
The guardians must be shown the way to recognize specialities of the child and to help and support them in order to fulfil their deficiencies .
There is also the need of special instruments to the child suffering with cerebral palsy .
With these instruments the children suffering with cerebral palsy are able to do many types of work easily .
Muscular dystrophy is one such disease in which the muscles continue becoming weak gradually .
Muscular dystrophyis of three types .
In the first type of the disease of muscular dystrophy the growth of the child occurs at first normally or a little gradually .
When the child is of 2 . years then he faces difficulty in walking , strolling , running , climbing etc .
Later on in muscular dystrophy difficulty comes in standing as well .
After some days the child is forced to stay lying on the bed .
In the other types the rate of the muscular dystrophy disease is less or more .
T . . is of many types , bones and joints also become its victim .
Due to the reason of T . . the rotation of the joints stops .
If T . . reaches to the spinal cord then hunch comes out and paralysis may attack .
In India around one and half crore people are affected with T . . And one fourth among these have become the victim of handicappedness .
The disease of lathyrism is a disease that occurs due to excessive use of grasspea .
Grasspea is cheap and is eaten by the poor class in the large area of Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Orissa .
Due to the use of grasspea first the person feels weakness in walking and then becomes obligated to take the prop of a stick .
Despite ban this grasspea is still eaten .
During to handicappedness there is much more psychological damage than the physical damage .
In fact with the information of handicappedness a very big shock is received to the person .
If we see from the scientific point of view then all the parts of our body work independently .
The effect of a bad or inactive organ is not seen on the other healthy organs .
There are very few such diseases which show effect on other organs together .
Therefore it may be believed that the reproductive organs of the handicapped person would be normal .
He can keep his partner happy by using his reproductive power and can fulfil family duties .
Those women who have damaged spinal cord they can also become pregnant .
During pregnancy the women with damaged spinal cord may have to face various types of complications .
These complications are untimely pain , ulcer due to pressure etc .
Because of the spinal cord being damaged these women fail to feel the movement of the foetus .
The delivery in such women is possible through foreceps and other other methods .
There is no difficulty to deaf and dumb in walking .
Mentally retarded or people suffering from psychological disorders also walk easily .
There is heavy difficulty to blind people and skeletally handicapped people in movement .
There is need of training for walking to blind people and skeletally handicapped people .
In new blind people there is huge lack of confidence .
Newly blinds become anxious on slight problem and in anxiety fail to even go for little approximation .
Therefore for such blind people the training of movement is that much essential as the learning of braille .
Blind person can recognize objects to very great extent with touch .
Blind person can estimate by touching by using hands or feet .
Blind person can estimate many things by smelling inside or outside the home .
On the basis of smell the blind person estimates many shops , factories or offices .
When we walk then the effect of the forthcoming obstacles is seen on our muscles and joints .
By this also we come to know to great extent as to where we are walking .
Different types of places grassy , road , sandy area or an area filled with mud puts different types of effects on the muscles and joints of our feet .
Similarly while traveling in bus , climbing up the stairs or while opening the doors our muscles feel differently .
On the basis of these feelings the blind can come to know of his situation and direction .
The person with sight should stand in front of the blind person .
The blind person should hold the arm of the blind person by standing one step back .
The skeletally challenged person also is made to learn movement .
After the sudden skeletal handicappedness where its physical capacity decreases , there its confidence also shatters .
In such while the skeletally challenged person is need of assisting instruments to move , there he also needs someone to give the right directions .
Stick is the oldest assisting instrument in which there is the use of straight wood .
On the upper part of the stick there is one handle .
At present there is also the use of aluminium stick which is light and strong .
Below this aluminium tip there is rubber tip which keeps a good hold on the floor .
When wheels are attached to the normal chair then it is called wheel chair .
After sitting on this chair the victim of serious handicappedness also can come up to some distance .
Motorised wheel chair for going inside and outside of house and office are also available which have brakes as well .
At present the complaint of contamination in things for eating and drinking are becoming common .
Ghee , oil , milk , spices and in fact in vegetables as well as the use of chemicals is a serious problem .
Certainly by consuming contaminated things we are straight away inviting diseases .
The chemicals mixed in these contaminated things affect our immune system directly , by which the problems of dehydration , vomiting etc may occur .
This way by the use of substances mixed with these chemicals there is a risk of the occurrence of the diseases connected to nervous system etc .
With contaminated things not just liver , but the effect is also seen on intestines .
We can overcome this problem , provided we stay cautious .
In order to stay away from the ill effects of contaminated food materials we must at first try to buy goods of good quality .
An alternative from being saved from contaminated food materials may be branded items , but many times complaints may arise even in them .
Therefore for you organic foods would be safe .
The biggest benefit of organic food products is this that no type of chemical substances can be used in them .
On the other hand the complaint of the mixing of fruits and vegetables and the use of chemicals to ripen them is also coming forward regularly .
This may also prove harmful with respect to health .
As such from the point of view of safety you must eat the fruit after peeing them off .
Similar things you can do with vegetables as well .
Not just this , you wash fruits and vegetables many times before use , so that , more and more color on them gets washed .
Just nutritive food is not essential , but staying cautious is also essential so that the chemicals do not go inside with nutrition in the body .
The problem of handicappedness is ancient and the efforts of their diagnosis are also equally ancient .
The level of technical development has been having continuous influence on these efforts .
The National institute for the Visually Handicapped have developed various types of assisting instruments for various purposes .
For the higher education of handicapped people latest braille slates , tailor 's frame , instruments to solve numericals and algebra , and kit helpful in geometry have also been prepared .
For the handicapped persons the set of pictures helpful in the study of physics have also been developed .
With the help of all these assisting instruments related to education the blind person can read new and every type of subjects .
For general blind persons tools for threading a needle , for shorthand etc have also been developed .
For the physical development and the entertainment of blind people many things of games have also been developed .
For the blind people the ringing balls in cricket and football etc have been developed .
Tactile chess for sitting down and playing , cards of braille , pocket frame etc have been manufactured .
For the locomotion of blind people the stick which is brought in use have also been developed .
Although the braille script has been of support for the blind people from long time but with time improvements have come in this as well .
Now one after the other such machines have come in which the typing of braille takes place as fast as possible .
The person types normal words on the computer and simultaneously the attached machine continues taking out the print in braille .
Now in less time newspaper , letters , magazines or books can be prepared .
Where such machines are being imported from foreign institutions there in India as well many organizations are doing research in this direction .
Voice synthesizer has also become common now and has become available in less price .
Whatever is fed into the computer , the attached voice synthesizer reads it aloud .
Previously the blind people used to get scared with calculation and maths .
now after the invention of voice calculator not just the anxiety of the blind people has vanished , but now they can also work at the place of calculations .
At present in our country there is adequate arrangement of making artificial leg or calliper etc according to severed legs or weak legs .
The leg is severed below the knee or above , the artificial leg can be fixed .
similarly to whatever extent of the leg is weak or distorted the callipers can be prepared and these are very helpful .
These callipers can be worn for many years easily .
In order to make club foot straight initially and or the making of special shoes according to them is also easy .
When the person becomes handicapped after becoming victim of a disease or accident then his treatment is done in various ways .
Among these various types of surgical treatment , physical treatment , physiotherapy , occupational therapy etc are included .
At present to great extent benefit has been observed in various cases of polio , leprosy , accidents .
In the country there is a web of the centres of ALIMCO and Mahavir Handicapped Institute where every type of artificial organ and calliper etc are available .
Through the surgical treatment the effort of making the patients of cerebral palsy normal is ongoing .
Due to the development in medical science the lost eye sight is retieved once again and the diseases do make the person blind .
The biggest example of this is earler people in large numbers used to become blind due to cataract .
Now with simple surgery the treatment of cataract is done .
Through the intra occular lens the person continues to take benefit of the complete sight capacity .
At present with the surgery transparency is brought back .
In the schools through the regular treatments of children prevention is applied on the diseases of eyes and the increasing diseases are corrected .
In various cases when the person starts living his life after considering himself blind then with the surgery of cornea he starts seeing .
Organisations like Mahavir Vikalang Sahayata Samiti have provided artificial organs to people by visiting villages and investigating on large scale .
Similarly in such camps the surgery of cataract of the eyes of people has been done successfully .
One more solution of the diagnosis of the problem of handicappedness is this that so much facilities and concessions should be given to the handicapped people so that there could be sufficient compensation to the losses occurring due to physical disabilities .
According to the order issued by the Railway Ministry blind people , physically challenged , deaf - dumb and mentally retarded people would get 75 percent concession on the fares of first class , second class and sleeper class .
Also in season ticket the handicapped people get 50 percent concession .
Leaving deaf - dumb the assistants traveling with all the other type of handicaps also get this much concession .
In air travel only Indian Airlines gives 50 percent concession to the blind people .
In order to give more and more employment to the handicapped people they are provided with 7 percent reservation in dealership .
The handicapped people need assisting tools in order to carry out normal work .
Therefore poor handicaps should be given assistance to buy tools .
People with the monthly income of twelve hundred rupees get the aid equipments worth 3600 rupees .
Volunteer institutions are given aids to educate children afflicted with cerebral palsy and mentally undeveloped children and for preparation of teachers and other experts to rehabilitate them .
In the same way institutions working for the rehabilitation of people after the treatment of leprosy and bringing them in the meanstream are also given up to 90 percent economical support .
The institutions that run special schools for the disabled people of different varieties are given economical aids up to 90 percent .
The districts which do not have special schools , this aid is given on a priority basis .
Besides this different aids programs are also run through district rehabilitation centres , regional rehabilitation centres .
Trachoma disease occurs due to a bacteria .
Trachoma disease gets spreading through the dirty hands , polluted towels etc. .
Flies also play an important role in spreading trachoma disease .
Trachoma disease is more in those areas where poor people live and there is a plethora of dust .
The areas having a lack of water also have trachoma in plenty .
Open and dirty toilets , open sewers , twittering of the flies also increase the number of trachoma disease .
In trachoma disease there is burning in the eye and the eye waters .
Due to the disease of trachoma the eyes also get reddened .
In such situation it is essential to keep the eyes clean .
Also by taking the advice of the doctor the treatment of trachoma should be started .
In the pain of the neck in yogasana the neck should be moved backwards for treatment .
Gradually bend the neck forwards .
Let the chin touch the voice box .
Rotate the neck from left to rigt and right to left with mild jerks .
In the pain of neck do sarpasana , bhujangasana , dhanurashana .
In the pain of the neck do pranayama and meditation .
In the pain of the neck move in open , fresh air .
The patients with neck pain should not do much mental work at the time of treatment .
Excess burden or tension should come on the neck , such work should not be done .
In the pain of neck tension free daily sleep of 6 . hours is very essential .
In the pain of neck attention should be paid on the right posture of sitting and sleeping .
If the patients of neck pain are standing then they should stand erect .
During the situation of sitting the back of the patient of the neck pain should absolutely be staright .
The patient of the neck pain should use hard slab for sleeping .
Do not use pillow below the neck .
While doing any work the spinal cord of the patient should lay straight .
This way the patient of the neck pain should get quick relief by balanced diet , natural treatment .
Abstain from eating food in the roadside eateries .
They use low quality oil for many days .
Clear soup and green vegetable are helpful in increasing appetite .
Abstain from naan and rumali roti because maida is used in them .
In their place eat missi roti  made of thick grains  and fulke .
In food take only one gravy vegetable .
The meaning of more gravy in food is excess fat .
It is even said , little gravy is sufficient .
Choose one type of food .
To not complement bhel and kachori with chopsey and pork windalu with sambhar wada .
The diet of three dishes is sufficient .
Escape from diet of five dishes .
State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food .
In food take wine or water instead of cola .
Wine can complement with Indian food .
Cola can give rise to gas related problems .
Contaminated water or vapor rich water has ill effects on digestive system .
These days due to gas , bile and phlegm separately or by the combination of two or all the three several types of disease must be arising .
Therefore in monsoon season fire must be safeguarded cautiously .
Due to the subduction of fire there are lethal consequences on health .
Due to the deformation of fire the person suffers from many types of disease .
During rainy season one should abstain from the consumption of fire enhancing medicines , gas reducer and digestion enhancer medicines .
One should drink mixing the juice of lentil etc . old barley , wheat , shali rice , shadras , mastu , black salt , pippali , pippalamool , chavya , chitrak and sonth .
The water of well or rain or boiled water should be consumed .
During the days of excess rain sour , mineral rich and fragrant cereals should be used .
In dryness honey rich easily digestive substance should be consumed .
Take bath after applying fragrant oil etc , wear the clothes after using perfume etc .
The clothes should be kept in the sun from time to time .
In the medicine world among the various popular methods of treatment the place of natural treatment is important .
Our body is a self controlled active tool .
The God has made the arrangement of self defense , health safety inside our body itself .
That system in which there is method of staying free of disease by supporting nature , there are rules that only is called natural treatment .
When people feel restless and uncomfortable after becoming infested with indigestion , weakness and rot due to wrong life-style , incompatible and untimely food then to get rid of them they use various medicines , injections .
Through these medicines , injections even more dirt gets accumulated in the body .
The disease is not eliminated by medicines .
One symptom of the complication gets suppressed and becomes the reason of another disease .
The body tries for its own defense .
The nature tries comprehensively to remove the dirt present in the body .
Naturopathy helps in removing and throwing away this dirt from our body .
Naturopathy makes the person healthy , strong and full of glow .
Fast , juice , fruits , balanced diet natural lifestyle are helpful in naturopathy .
With the method of air , sunlight - water , massage , exercise , pranayam any disease is destroyed from the root .
State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food .
Like in the villages as pollution arises in the drains and streets of villages disease is produced due to them .
Likewise dirt is accumulated in the body .
This dirt of the body can not be excreted through the medium of toilet , urine sweat etc and starts percolating inside .
That dirt of the body is the root of all the diseases .
If your disease is not able to be rectified by any medicine then get a new life by adopting new natural treatment .
Health is natural and disease is unnatural .
When we follow the rules of body and life then the health is natural .
When we ignore the rules of body and life , overlook then the disease is unnatural .
The normal reaction of the normal situation of life force is health and abnormal reaction is disease .
This condition of abnormal reaction is the reason of disease alone .
Therefore we can say that those symptoms because of which the situations of disease are produced they should be corrected .
No effort should be taken in order to suppress the symptoms through traditional contemporary method and medicines .
Traditional treatment method has always followed the short - term treatment policy .
The excess pressure of traditional treatment stays on treatment .
Traditional treatment method does not rely on the philosophy of staying free of disease .
We know that for the treatment of disease traditional treatment method has left no stone unturned in every possible research .
The treatment of disease depends on the basis as to in what form do we take our disease .
There is immense attack on the body in the form of medicine , injection etc .
By that action procedure the patient becomes disease free , this is the general belief among people .
On the basis of this wrong belief the use of all types of medicines are used on the diseases .
That is simple cough and cold or dangerous cancer disease .
The nature tries to maintain balance in the body .
In the human body health and disease are two separate self religions in the human body .
Natural medicine never claims that it can free from all the stages of all types of dangerous diseases .
But it definitely lays stress on the fact that by understanding the creative process of nature dependent rules certainly the people suffering with dangerous diseases can be helped .
The fact is that at present the extent to which people have the knowledge of destructive forces that much less they have the knowledge about the process of life force .
In the natural treatment the treatment is done of the patient and not of the disease .
On the occurrence of disease for the treatment of disease it is important to stick to the rules of health and essential to stay away from the habits which produce disease , matter and diet which produce the same .
By abiding by the rules of health only all types of diseases are cured .
By following the rules of health the treatment of the dangerous disease like cancer also is possible in the present times .
For the treatment of disease adopt any where and any type of method .
Eat medicines , but if you do not restricy yourself in food habits then the disease would not be corrected .
Someone consumes alcohol , is in the habit of smoking cigarette , bidi and his liver has become infectious , is suffering from rheumatism , arthritis , psyctic disease etc .
For these diseases the person eats different types of medicines .
Natural treatment is also done .
But if they do not quit alcohol , cigarette , bidi etc then one can not get rid of the disease .
By spending money of lacs and crores one can not free oneself of disease , till the time one does not follow the rules of health .
Natural treatment is proud that the treatment of all types of diseases is possible in natural treatment .
If the person will get the treatment done and do not quit the habits leading to disease , then is its treatment possible ?
This is also true that if the person gets the treatment done by staying in any natural hospital , where he is given diet and treatment under strict vigilence .
The bad habits of the patient are removed with strictness .
In that duration of staying in hospital it is natural to get relief .
After coming back from the hospital again old habits , eating habits , and the rules of healthy life style are left , then again there is attack of the diseases .
The nature has given immense power to every living being to stay disease free .
In order to rid us from diseases modern scientific development makes us aware of the behavioural and non destructive enriched energy of the nature .
If once you become complete by the nature and follow its rules then you would always appear healthy and full of lively youth .
In order to maintain health balanced diet , self control , yoga and exercise are essential .
Good health is ultimate bliss .

In order to remove foreign particles accumulated in the intestines and to increase the power of the intestines the use of anima is done .
For anima generally the quantity of water is from 500 m . . To 1500 m . .
This quantity of water is also dependent on the acceptance of the patient .
The quantity of water which the patient can retain in his intestine , only that much of water he should be allowed to take .
There are many methods of taking anima .
In one condition after lying flat and leaving the abdomen region loose both the knees are folded upwards .
In the second condition by lying on the left side the right leg should be folded from the knee .
The pot of anima should be kept three feet above the bench .

What is balanced diet ?
Form food the only aim of man is not just to fill stomach , gain health or fulfil taste , but also to bring about mind , character and spiritual growth .
The interest of man towards various types of foods is the symbol of his conduct and recognition .
Therefore in food the consumption of those types of foods should be done which is helpful in physical , mental , principle , social and spiritual enhancement .
Balanced diet develops love , affection , friendship , forgiveness , tenderness , non violence peace etc properties .
Grow the feeling of respect and honor toward the humans .
Those foods in which there is no fulfillment of the above mentioned things and the consequences come the opposite instead , that food can not be called balanced .
What type is nutritive diet ?
In the food the eleme  nts providing energy , strength and heat to the body like proteins , glucose , fat , minerals , vitamins etc should be present in proper ratio and sufficient quantity .
Due to which the growth of good cells in the body continues to take place .
According to one 's own financial ability , the selection of those substances may be done depending on the likeness and availabilty and personal necessity from the substances of various categories .
Nutritive substances are also present in vegetarian food materials .
Today many doctors and people consider consuming nonvegetarian food for protein and calorie due to misleading advertisements .
But in many vegetarian food materials also protein , calorie , vitamins and nutritive substances are available in sufficient quantity .
In nonvegetarian items  the outer part of pulses , cereals etc  there is no quantity of fiber present at all .
This has been ascertained by the scientists that fiber has a lot of importance in preventing diseases .
Vitamins are also essential for our health .
The source of these vitamins are vegetable substances only .
The main source of food for animals and humans is the food obtained by agriculture or plants .
The proteins which are found in meat , those also are obtained from plants alone .
Therefore getting nutrition directly from vegetable substances is better than from that secondary nutrition which in animal meat has also been obtained from vegetable substances .
Some people spread this rumor that egg is a complete nutrition .
Vitamin . , carbohydrates and fiber are not found at all in eggs .
Egg , meat , fish etc are acidic food due to which there is removal of calcium from the bones and due to this type of loss occurring of calcium it takes longer for the bone to rejoin after fracture .
There is also more cholesterol in eggs .
Any type of toxic substance can not arise in balanced diet prepared by mixing fruits , green vegetables , various types of lentils , seeds and milk .
Its main reason is that when an animal dies then it becomes dead substance .
This does not apply to vegetables .
If any vegetable is cut even half and its half part is put inside the ground then it will grow again in the form of vegetable or tree .
This is possible only because vegetable is a living substance .
This thing can not be said for a lamb , goat or chicken .
From the other special sources it has been found this that when an animal is killed then it becomes afraid and the toxic substance released due to fear sprears in his body .
That same toxic substance reaches the body of those people in the form of meat who eat them .
Our body is not completely capable of excreting all those toxic substances .
The acid base balance is essential in food .
Many doctors believe that the reason of disease in body is the imbalance of acid-base .
It is such belief of doctors that in our body there are approximately 80 percent are basic substances and approximately 20 percent are acidic substances .
But in our food attention is not paid on the ratio of acid - base .
It is the belief that in the peels of maximum fruits and vegetables generally there is more basic substance and in the inner part there is acidic substance more .
Therefore the doctors advice to eat the edible substances without removing the peels .
But in the present times due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the consumption of cereals and vegetables without washing them properly and with peels may also become the reason of harm because of some part of poison remaining in them .
The aim of saying is this only that instead of giving importance to one sided thought with respect to food , we should take decision after thinking on every side with multiple point of view as per the weather and physical needs .
But in no case the natural doctrines of Nature should be ignored .
According to Chinese Panch Tatva doctrines various tastes have relations with different organs of the body .
Natural doctors have such beliefs that liver and pancreas are affected by sour taste .
Hot taste has relation with lungs and large intestine .
Sweet taste has direct relation with spleen and gall bladder .
The heart and small intestines etc are affected by bitter taste .
With these tastes not just our organs get affected but the nutrition of these organs also take place .
The doctors consider the balance of taste in foood alone as the base of health .
The doctors treat by balancing various tastes .
The food should be according to the weather .
Those food materials which are obtained maximum from the nature in that month , is generally considered to be good from the point of view of health .
Maximum birds - animals which do not accumulate food and lead a carefree life lead there life on the basis of available fruits , leaves alone .
The nature gives complete support in order to keep each person healthy .
All the animals eat only those things , which is available around them .
Animals do not import food materials from other places .
The laws of nature are equal for every one poor and rich .
Therefore the consumption of expensive , unseasonal , imported food material is always useful for health , is completely false .
Balanced diet itself does the work of medicine .
Such is the belief of dieticians that the relation of maximum physical diseases is due to food related ill habits , carelessness and inattentiveness .
The chief reason of this is our ignorance about right food , greed for taste , lack of timely thoughtfulness , lack of prudence , immoral conduct , selfish point of view etc .
In various medical methods attentiveness towards diet is an important part of treatment .
In natural treatment diet only is given the maximum importance for health and treatment .
According to the point of view of natural doctors and dieticians food alone is the medicine .

Sugar is only a type of sweetness , no type of nutritive substance is obtained from it .
The heart is damaged by eating sugar .
In 1949 one Japanese doctor had researched on sugar .
As a result of the use of excess sugar the disease of hypoglucamia disease has spread in Europe and America .
In the patient suffering with hypoglucamia initially he feels physical weakness , then there is false hunger and then sweating .
The body of the patient at times starts shivering and he also becomes unconscious .
The doctors have said that for this disease sugar only is responsible .
Due to sugar there is also a type of indigestion and constipation .
After the arrival of sugar in stomach it produces a type of burning in stomach and intestines .
This happens due to the acid produced during the digestion of sugar .

How should the food be in rough cold ?
Wrong food becomes the reason of cold in at least nine out of ten people .
Generally people eat anything that comes in front .
People eat all types of things together .
The question of food is extremely important for the patient of cold .
Chew the food very well and eat gradually .
Abiding by it is essential both for the patient as well as healthy .
Cold occurs due to the consumption of wrong food .
Wrong food produces more than expected indigestion .
gas and acidity is produced by indigestion .
Later on poison is produced due to the rotting of food in the intestine .
Some portion of these undigested food gets absorbed by the blood because of which it becomes polluted and acidic .
That blood travels in all the parts of the body and makes each corner diseased .
When all the veins of blood and body become polluted then some or the other disease should definitely occur and often it gets manifested in the form of cold .
Be light eater in food .
Prepare the food very plain .
Eat fresh things sufficiently and abstain from pickle , jelly , chutney and canned food to the extent possible .
Eat milk , cream and paneer in small quantity .

Those whose eye color has become bad they should not eat cream or paneer till the time its color becomes clear .
Eat some fresh fruits and raw vegetables daily and certainly .

Why do you get tired ?
Tiredness has become a normal disease of modern age .
Every where tired people are visible .
The labourer is physically tired , intellectuals are tired in mental way .
Working women have become tired due to bearing double responsibitlity .
In this fast paced world every one is tired .
One disease is the tiredness occuring without any reason .
Some person who does no do any physical and mental work leading to tiredness , then also every time tiredness keeps them surrounded .
When this feeling of tiredness enters you permanently , then the problem becomes more complex .
According to psychologists , the condition of the reduction of interests and desires only is tiredness .
Which serially decreases and increases in proportion to interests and wishes .
In normal meaning the physical and mental tiredness of man may be considered tiredness .
In scientific language this situation may be called called neursthania .
Among the mental disorders due to tiredness the names of worry , tension , boredom and inner conflict can be counted .
These things are common in the stressful life of the present world .
Those people who are not able to strike balance of the situations on the mental level , they finally become the victims of tiredness .
More than the relation which tiredness has with body , more than that it is related to your psychological state .
If you are suffering with disease like fatigue then you should introspect your entire life - style .
After finding the reasons of tensions honestly try to remove them .
For escaping from tiredness stay happy and cheerful always .
Whether the tiredness is physical or mental , it can be removed by bringing holistic change in life - style , food , regular excercise and mental level .
In the scene of unusual fatigue take the advice of your doctor .
It is essential to abstain from the diseases of acidity and ulcer .
Abstain from the consumption of smoking , tobacco , pan masala , alcohol etc .

Vomitting , loss of appetite , fear from having food due to pain , swelling of stomach , heart burn etc are the symptoms of acidity .
That wound is called peptic ulcer which is formed in the upper part of the small intestine  deudenum  , stomach or the lower part of the food pipe .
These are serially called deudenal ulcer , gastric ulcer and oesophageal ulcer .
Keep in mind , that it is not important that every patient having pain in the upper part of the stomach should have ulcer or acidity .
For the diagnosis of the symptoms of the deudenal ulcer of patient some laboratory tests are done after the extensive information and physical examination .
In these tests stool tests , endoscopy and borium x - ray are main .
If the patient is consuming smoke , alcohol , pan masala then quitting them is extremely essential .
To the extent possible escape from excessive mental tension and take rest as much as possible .
Eat food slowly after chewing it properly and the food to be eaten in two times should be taken four - five times .
Any such type of food because of which the pain and discomfort of the patient increases , do not take .
By proper food and quitting intoxication the patient will get relief from the symptoms .
Do not consider this as sufficient but the complete healing of the food is also important , because of which the symptoms do not occur again .
For this take medication by staying in the vigilance of a good doctor .
Why and how should high blood pressure be controlled ?
Today 's consumerism , tension and competitive life , wrong eating habits , lack of rest alone are the chief root of high blood pressure .
This decreases and increases day - night .
On the development of blood pressure once it can stay for the entire life without any difference .
In the world more than 60 crore people have been registered as the patients of high blood pressure .
Finally this is also considered as the reason of heart attacks .
Because of persisitent high blood pressure continuous damage reaches to brain , heart , kidneys , pancreas and reproductive organs .
Since it can not be felt continuously , but it can bring the damage which can not be corrected .
Because of maintained high blood pressure it can produce stroke in the brain .
Which is considered as the most dangerous situation .
Excessively increased blood pressure tears the weak vessels after damaging them .
Consequently there is localized bleeding .
It produces paralysis .
Similarly by increasing the pressure in blood vessels high blood pressure produces the stroke of heart .
Which creates permanent damage to the heart muscles because of which that portion becomes dead like and brings growth in the heart .
Because the above mentioned heart attack , after creating lack of oxygen in the quantity obtained through the blood to the muscles of the heart produces pain in the chest which is called enzyna .
If this resource of oxygen and blood becomes increasingly less then it would be called the stroke of heart .
When the blood pressure starts increasing then the resource of blood in the rest of the organs decreases because of the increased accumulation of blood in the heart .
The increased pressure within the heart damages the walls and the openings of the heart and produces tension .
The high blood pressure affects the activity of blood purification after contracting the blood vessels .
After its permanence the purification of blood becomes abnormal and becomes the reason of the infection of kidney and other disorders .
Since through the knidney the adverse substances for the body are removed daily post digestion through the urinary passage .
But due to abnormal activity these substances return to the body again and make the body poisonous and become the reason of kidney failure .
The increased pressure for long duration enhances the pressure in the blood vessel which take the blood to the retina and may even tear them .
Due to which the blood secretion occuring on the body may take away the eye - sight permanently .
With the increase of age the blood vessels lose the property of their flexibility after becoming stiff .
These stiff vessels are called vessel stiffness .
Due to these very arteries the high blood pressure create more dangers and make the situation extremely serious and damages heart , brain , kidney .
Due this very difficulty of artery some it also weakens the feet .
For high blood pressure control consult the related doctor and get the tests done .
In high blood pressure test lipid frofa , blood urea , blood sugar . . . . etc . are done .
After this as per the doctor advice are given as to which salt to use for food , what exercise to take , how to sleep etc. .
One should take permanent advice from his family doctor .
Do not change doctor and treatment again and again , it always takes some time in controlling .
If our weight is more than normal then we should decrease it immediately .
Do not take fried , salty or fatty food or take it minimally .
Do not eat stomach-full or again and again .
Drink more cold water this water receives additional energy from the body and increases its consumption .
Avoid non-vegetarian food and if you eat then along with it eat only fruit and green vegetable and salad three times more .
Do not take wine , tobacco , cold drinks and junk-food etc. .
Use unpeeled grains and lentils .
One must walk 5 kms everyday with speed in morning or in the evening .
One must sit at least 20 minutes for yoga and 10 minutes for meditation .

Due to frequent blood donation , such a person might be weak and afflicted with different kinds of disease , out of which some can even be deadly such as jaundice , AIDS etc .
The amount of iron in the person donating blood frequently might be much less than that of a healthy person .
Because such a person keeps on donating blood prior to the time of donating blood again due to economic compulsions .
Because of not taking nutritive food many types of diseases can occur to blood donator person .
Only when the use of blood is very essential then only blood donation should be done because on the occurrence of slight carelessness and reaction the life of the patient can go .

The blood should always be used of relatives and friends , about whom you have complete knowledge .
If you have to get the surgery done on the definite date then you youself get your blood extracted before the surgery and have it kept to be used during the surgical process .

In the modern times by using the various components of blood the demand for blood can be reduced .

Learn the difference between cholestrol and fat .
Fat can alone increase your weight but cholestrol alone can not increase your weight .
In 9 out of 10 people the reason behind obesity is the presence of both the fat and the cholestrol .
When the cholestrol is in the body in normal quantity then it plays an important role in keeping the artries of the heart healthy .
It is very important for health that the cholestrol be in normal quantity .
It is produced in the liver of our body by the nature .
If there is too much cholestrol in the body then it leads to the disease ` Aeksklerosis ' .
In the ` Aeksklerosis ' disease . wax-like substance is secreted in the artries which makes them very narrow .
Due to this wax-like substance blood is not able to flow properly which leads to heart attack .
HDL cholestrol is a high density lipoprotein .
Its job is to clear the way of the blood flow such that the work of the heart mechanism goes on smoothly .
We can call HDL cholestrol the good cholestrol .
LDL cholestrol is a low density lipoprotein .
LDL cholestrol accumulates in the artries by combining with the fat which causes obstacle in the flow of the blood .
Due to the obstacle in the blood flow , there is a danger of heart disease .
We can call LDL cholestrol the bad cholestrol .
Vegetable fat is unsaturated lipid .
Because of vegetable ghee and the process of organic hydrogenation , vegetable oil takes the solid form in the room temperature .
Vegetable fat is not so harmful as saturated fat .
As far as obesity is concerned both kinds of fat increases obesity .
Animal fat the fat found in all kinds of meat and milk products comes under this category .
Animal fat is saturated fat , which means that it becomes solid from liquid at room temperature . It increases the fat cells of our body which leads to increase in the weight .
Animal fat , along with the bad cholestrol , reduces the blood flow towards the mind and the heart .
If you want to remain healthy then before having your food first see how much is the quantity of the cholestrol and the fat .
Endocrine glands have a very important place in our body .
When endocrine glands secrete in enough quantity then our helath remains perfect but in case of the opposite our health malfunctions hence it is compulsory for us to keep them healthy under any condition .
Because of these endocrine glands someone is found to be extremely small , some tall , some fat and some absolutely thin .
Eunuchs are also the result of the abnormality of these endocrine glands .
Sometimes you would have seen hairs on the face of the girls and boys without moustache and beards and would have heard of sex change all this is the result of the abnormality of the endocrine glands .
It is clear from all this that secretion of the endocrine glands keep a balance on our mental development , internal and external activities and behavior etc. .
The hormone secreting from the pancreat gland is insulin .
Pancreat gland keeps a control over the quantity of insulin .
When the body has excessive glucose then the secretion of insulin converts into glucose and due to the lack of insulin diabetes occurs .
Thyroid glands are of the shape of the shield and they are situated in the throat on the both sides of the trachea .
The hormone secreted from thyroid glands is called thyroxin and it controls the growth of the body and the rate of the heart beat .
It is helpful in proper usage of carbohydrate .
In case of deficiency of glucose in the body the secretion of thyroxin helps in the formation of glucose by separating carbohydarte from other substances and controls the quantity of calcium .
In case of throxin becoming over-active phosphate along with calcium is lost from the bone and it begins to come in excretion and consequently the bones become thin and weak .
Parathroids are four in number and they are situated attached to the throid glands .
The hormone secreted in it helps in keeping the optimum quantity of calcium and phosphate in the blood .
Its deficiency lead to tetanus , calcium deficiency and increase in phosphorous .
The secretion of liver and stomach removes the deficiency of blood .
The secretion of liver and stomach increases the red blood cells in the blood .
Adrenal gland is also called suprarenal gland it is near the kidneys .
Every gland has two parts .
The outer part is called adrenal cortex and the inner part is called adrenal almedula .
The secretion of the outer part of the bordering kidney has a great importance .
The removal of outer part by operation causes immediate death .
The outer part is essential for life .
The sexual feelings are balanced by these hormones .
Due to more secretion than required untimely sexual development takes place .
For example periods and complete development of sexual organs in 2-4 years old girls .
Testes in the males and ovaries in the females are present in the form of sexual glands .
We call the juice secreted by these sex glands the sex hormone and it is this which gives maleness to the males and femaleness to the females .
Pituitary gland is the part of the brain itself and it is very small in size .
Several types of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland .
It is because of these hormones that the hormones secreted by the rest of the glands is produced in the right quantity and their work is completely controlled .
It is very necessary for the normal development .
When these hormones do not work properly then even the giant-sized children could also be born .
These hormones are very helpful in removing the dwarfism .
The elements that develops then is produced in the front part of the pituitary gland .
The secretion of these glands is chemical and their work is also to produce chemical effect .
Taking bath in cold water leads to the formation and the secretion of hormones within the body on time and in proper form .
When these glands get live food then they do their work properly .
Use of fresh pure cold water is helpful in their secretion .
Therefore in order to improve the chemical work of these glands , we should take the complete chemical elements obtained by unripe food whether you take it in the form of water by taking the juice or just the unripe food in itself .
Because of the use of cold water the glands secrete properly by becoming strong and fired up .
The property of unripe food is also cold and that of acidic ripe potato hot .
Therefore unripe food is necessary for the proper development and secretion of these glands .
Besides these endocrine glands , dineal gland and thymous gland also have an important place .
Sufficient secretion by Pineal gland leads to proper secretion and development of sexual glands and it is also helpful in the mental development .
Because of the proper secretion of thymous gland , sexual maturity comes on time .
It is necessary to know about the deficiency signs of the endocrine glands so that the related glands could be fired up .
When absorption and release process of carbohydrate could not take place completely due to the deficiency of insulin then diabetes occurs .
In case of deficiency of thyroxin , along with obesity and goitre , the absorption of iron could not take place sufficently .
In case of deficiency of secretion by the sexual gland , there is a lack of maleness and femaleness .
In case of deficiency of secretion by pituitary gland , alongwith dwarfism , strength also diminishes and complete inaction could even lead to death .
In case of deficiency of secretion by pineal gland , there is an untimely development of sexual maturity and there is an improper mental development .
In case of deficiency of secretion by thymous gland the development of sexual organs is not proper and complete .
In case of deficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland , the life force diminishes and in complete inaction could even lead to death .
In this way the proper understanding of the indications caused by the deficiency of secretion is very helpful in removing the deficiency .
Cytica is a disease of nerves .
In the inner portion of the body , cytica nerve is a long nerve in comparison to the others .
Coming out of the lower end of the spine , it has gone towards the leg from behind the ankles .
The pain which it causes is called cytica .
This pain originates at the back and sometimes spread till the toe of the leg .
But generally the pain is caused by the part of this very nerve .
It is always limited at the back side .
The pain of cytica is very painful and it can be compared to the pain of the toothache .
This disease generally remains from several weeks to several months and in difficult circumstances it can carry on till several years .
Cytica occurs due to cold , residence in damp place , paralysis of the muscles and constipation etc. .
When due to these reasons the blood flow becomes poisonous and the cytica nerve becomes agitated by this poison and swelling appears in it then this disease appears .
Therefore in many areas cytica is called a kind of neuritis .
Sometimes as a result of an injury to the lower portion of the spine the cytic nerve is affected causing this disease .
It is said that this condition arises by standing or walking for a long time , bending suddendly , picking up heavy weight etc. .
In cytica disease it is extremely important to make the patient healthy along with the local treatment .
For this it is specially important to pay attention towards the methodology .
But now because of the emergence of different diseases and allergies by the use of artificial resources , people have begun to give importance to the natural alternative .
It is necessary to give special attention towards the formation of acid-accumulation in the patient 's body .
In many situations this disease appears bcause of the decrease in acid .
If one can fast one day before the treatment then the patient is sufficiently benefitted .
In all the old diseases one should fast in some form .
The body gets cleansed by fasting .
Other dietary methods are similar to mental weakness .
How natural are the beauty products .
Nature is not just the beauty source but also a big source of beauty products .
We get such natural things from it which increases the beauty of our skin and hair as well as eliminates their diseases .
Our body has the wonderful capacity to absorb the beneficial effects of these herbs .
Their speciality is that they do not have any negative or harmful effects on the body .
India 's famous and internationally recognized beauty specialist Shahnaz Hussain believes that ` Ako prepared by the vegetation and herbs has a very important place in the area of beauty industry .
They along with keeping the skin clean also nourishes them .
It increase the blood flow and brings glow to the skin .
It also makes the skin free of diseases .
Today beauty products made of artificial chemicals in the form of beauty materials is quite popular .
In the cities and towns artificial face cream , shampoo , remover , hair oil etc are used in abundance .
But due to the emergence of different diseases and allergies people have now begun to give importance to the natural alternative .
A lot of beauty products are now being sold in the market in the name of ` natural ' .
Are they really natural .
Generally this question is a mystery for the consumers .
If we take a look at the advertisements then it is so that in the name of ` natural ' and ` herbal ' mostly chemical products are being sold .
Generally instead of taking the ready made herbal or natural beauty products available in the market if we prepare it in the home in consultation with a qualified herbal specialist then it is better .
Although in the busy life this is definitely a little difficult for every woman or man yet it is the best .
Some dependable herbal beauty products could be used .
The herbal products of the famous beauty specialist Shahanaz Hussain is also becoming quite popular now a days .
Among these products like Shazema , Shalife , Shasilk , Shaleshm , Shabright , Shaclean , Shamlo , Shataj , etc are quite popular .
For hair specially Shaneem , Shacare , Shahair , Shahina , Shatone , Shamla etc are famous .
Even Shahnaz Hussain does not give guarantee about her products .
She says that the way there is a reaction on the skin by the use of artifical products , in the same way there could be a harmful reaction from the products made up of herbs .
So the guarnatee of the color and oneness of the products in every batch can not be given .
But there is no reduction in the effectiveness of the products because of our dependence on the nature .
It is also good to forget .
In the lives of all of us there are many moments worth forgetting .
It would have happened with you that some name might have been there in your mind but that does not come to your tongue .
Sometime you forget after keeping the keys somewhere .
It is believed by the zoologists that even behind this incomplete memory of the humans also there is a motive .
Some people are unwavering in their belief that if we want a permanent impression of knowledge then it is necessary that our memory be incomplete .
If we could remember everything at the conscious level then we would go crazy .
Everything would have gone awry by the memory of smaller events , therefore it is good that we remember only the important things .
Healthy mind exists in a healthy body .
If your age is more than forty years and exercise four or five times a week then surely you could beat in memory that person of your age who do not exercise .
If you do not exercise regularly then leave your laziness now .
The wonderful tonic for the mind is the exercise .
It improves the flow of blood to the brain .
Our memory increases automatically .
Solving crosswords , puzzles and playing games like chess and cards sharpens your memory .
These games benefit slowly and at micro level now it depends on you which game you like .
Write all the things to remember briefly on a piece of paper .
This way this information will go into your memory .
With this your mind becomes free to memorise other things .
The storage of your memory is limited .
It will not be pressurized a lot if the list is made .
Whatever happens is not completely independent from the other events .
Pay attention to these events .
Very easily the description of any particular event will begin to flash in the mind .
If the mind does not co-operate , even then such facts could be searched in any book of general knowledge .
By combining the events sequentially in this way many times our mind begins to think in the right direction .

Anus is there on the edge of the large intestine .
There are three bands formed inside the large intestine at a difference of one and a half fingers that assist in expelling stool out of anus .
Swelling arises inside anus by decomposition of stool .
First tiny rashes erupt in anus .

Writing down the problems and symptoms of the woman helps a lot in diagnosing the basic  real  reason of the disease .
For how long is this disease and problem there .
When and how did the suffering started .

It can even lead to the wrong treatment .
If it becomes known that blood-loss was from uterus then its relation should be deduced from the menstruation cycle , pregnancy and during the pregnancy and abortion .
Because of the excess of bleeding , anemia could arise in the patient , which is called the second hemorhhage .
In such a situation it should also be enquired from the patient whether lumps of blood have also formed .
What has been the color of the lost blood .
Whether this color is the same as that of the blood of the period or of a different color .
It is necessary to ask all these questions from the patient .
One should note the date of the last period .
After listening to the complete description by the patient and writing it in the history sheet , one should carry out her physical examination .
Under this first of all , one should carefully look at the face and the body of the patient to see whether there is deficiency of blood .
Also examine the teeth of the patient carefully and see if there is any cavity in the teeth and if pus or blood is coming out of the gums .
Also ascertain whether her brain and muscles are weak through conversation with the patient .

Before examining the lower part of the abdomen by touching , one should also grope to check whether the parts like liver , gall bladder , spleen and kidneys have become bigger or not .
Whether the patient feels any problem while touching or pressing these body parts .
Similarly one should try to find any type of pain , swelling or hardness etc near the naval and abdomen area while examing the lower part of the abdomen by touching it .

The heartbeat of the child could also be heard in the belly .
Those women on whose abdomen there are thin , whitish lines then it is an indication of the fact that she has miscarried earlier also .
